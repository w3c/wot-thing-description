  <section id="abstract">
This document describes a formal model and common representation for a Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description. A Thing Description describes the metadata and interfaces of Things, where a Thing is an abstraction of a physical or virtual entity that provides interactions to and participates in the Web of Things. Thing Descriptions provide a set of interactions based on a small vocabulary that makes it possible both to integrate diverse devices and to allow diverse applications to interoperate. 
Thing Descriptions, by default, are encoded in JSON-LD. 
JSON-LD provides both a powerful foundation to represent knowledge about Things and simplicity, since it allows processing as a JSON document. 
A Thing Description instance can be hosted by the Thing itself or hosted externally due to Thing's resource restrictions (e.g. limited memory space) or when a Web of Things-compatible legacy device is retrofitted with a Thing Description.

<!-- for devices.
The TD must be acquired to use and interact with the Thing, since it describes the semantics of a Thing as well as its <a>WoT Interface</a>. Usually, Things directly provide their own TD, but the TD can also be hosted externally if there is not enough space on the device or when a WoT-compatible legacy device is retrofitted with a TD.-->

  <section id="introduction">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
The W3C Thing Description (TD) is a central building block in a Web of Things (WoT) enabled system and can be considered as the entry point of a Thing (aka the <i>index.html</i> of the Thing). 
The TD consists of semantic metadata for the Thing itself, an interaction model based on WoT's <code>Properties</code>, <code>Actions</code>, and <code>Events</code> paradigm, a semantic schema to make data models machine-understandable, and features for Web Linking to express relations among Things. 
</p>
<p>
Properties can be used for controlling (or retrieving) parameters, such as a setting an operation state (or getting the current value). Actions model invocation of physical processes, but can also be used to abstract RPC-like calls of existing platforms. Events cover the push model where state change notifications, discrete events, and streams of values are sent asynchronously to the receiver. In general, the TD provides metadata for the different communication bindings (e.g., HTTP, CoAP, MQTT, etc.), mediaTypes (e.g., "application/json", "application/xml", "application/cbor", "application/exi" etc.), and security policies (authentication, authorization, etc.). The serialization of the TD instances is based on JSON and includes at least the TD core vocabulary as JSON keys as defined in this specification document.
</p>

<p>
Example 1 shows a simple TD instance in such a JSON serializiation that reflects WoT's <code>Properties</code>, <code>Actions</code>, and <code>Events</code> paradigm by describing a lamp Thing with the name <i>MyLampThing</i>.
</p>

<pre id= "simple-thing-description-sample" class="example" title="Simple Thing Description Sample">
{
    "id": "urn:dev:wot:com:example:servient:lamp",
    "name": "MyLampThing",
    "security": [{"scheme": "basic"}],
    "properties": {
        "status" : {
            "type": "string",
            "forms": [{"href": "https://mylamp.example.com/status"}]
        }
    },
    "actions": {
        "toggle" : {
            "forms": [{"href": "https://mylamp.example.com/toggle"}]
        }
    },
    "events":{
        "overheating":{
            "type": "string",
            "forms": [{"href": "https://mylamp.example.com/oh"}]
        }
    }
}
 </pre>




<p>Based on this content, we know there exists one <code>Property</code> interaction resource with the name <i>status</i>. In addition, information is provided such as that this Property is accessible via (the secure form of) the HTTP protocol with a GET method (default assumption as described in the W3C WoT protocol template deliverable [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]]) at https://mylamp.example.com/status (announced within the <code>forms</code> structure by the <code>href</code> key), which will return a string status value.
</p>

<p>In a similar manner an <code>Action</code> is specified to toggle the switch status using the POST method that is applied to the https://mylamp.example.com/toggle resource (see the HTTP protocol binding description in the W3C WoT protocol template deliverable [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]]).</p>

<p>The WoT's <code>Event</code> model enables a mechanism for events to be notified by a Thing. Here, a subscription of a possible overheating event of the lamp can be applied by using the default event-handling mechanism defined in the protocol binding for HTTP at https://mylamp.example.com/oh (see the HTTP protocol binding description in the W3C WoT protocol template deliverable [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]]).
</p>

<p>
The TD in Example 1 reflects some additional defined default assumptions that are not explicitly described. E.g., this includes that the media type of the exchange format of the interactions is assumed to be JSON (=<code>mediaType</code>) and the <code>Property</code> <i>status</i> definition is not writable as well as not observable. Thus, the TD specification defines vocabulary terms (<code>writable</code>, <code>observable</code>, <code>mediaType</code>) that have default values. If these vocabulary terms are not explicit used in a Thing Description instance, the Thing Description processor follows default assumptions for interpretation as defined in this specification.

</p>
<p>The TD can be also processed as an RDF-based model. In that case, the Thing Description instance can be simply transformed into valid JSON-LD.  In terms of JSON-LD 1.1 serialization, RDF semantic processing's open-world assumption requires vocabulary terms with default values to be always present explicitly in the instances. Example 2 shows the same TD in a JSON-LD 1.1 serializiation containing identical information as in Example 1.

<section id="vocabularyDefinitionSection"><h1>Information Model</h1><!-- h1>Vocabulary</h1 --><section><h2>Overview</h2><p>The W3C Thing Description provides a set of vocabulary for describing physical and virtual Things.

For the core vocabulary the focus is on well-established security  mechanisms, such as those built into protocols supported by WoT  or already in wide use with those protocols.  Note that the vocabulary extension mechanism of the WoT Thing Description allows for additional security schemes if needed.  The current set of security schemes is partly based on <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#securitySchemeObject">OpenAPI 3.0.1</a>.  The security schemes, vocabulary and syntax given in this specification share many similarities with OpenAPI; however, it is not fully compatible.  Also, as OpenAPI targets only web services built around HTTP it does not cover the full set of use cases required for the IoT.  Therefore, we are currently discussing metadata supporting additional security mechanisms for IoT-centered protocols such as CoAP and MQTT.

    <h1 >Thing Description Serialization</h1>

      <p class="ednote" title="JSON-LD 1.1 ">
	This is the first draft that uses JSON-LD 1.1 as a serialization format of the Thing Description. The working assumption is based on the <a href="https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/#">Community Draft of JSON-LD 1.1</a>. There is the plan to setup a JSON-LD Working Group with the following <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/03/jsonld-wg-charter.html">JSON-LD Working Group Charter</a>. It is planned that this section always conforms to the latest working assumptions of JSON-LD 1.1.
      </p>

<p>
Thing Description instances are modeled and structured based on the <a href="#vocabularyDefinitionSection" class="sec-ref">Thing Description Information Model</a>. This section proposes a TD serialization based on JSON-LD 1.1. 
</p>



<section id="json-serializiation-section">
    <h1>Representation Format</h1>

<p>This section introduces the JSON-based serialization of the Thing Description that also follows the syntax of JSON-LD 1.1 to streamline the semantic evaluation of TDs.</p>

<p>Mainly, all vocabulary terms as defined in <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definitions" class="sec-ref">Vocabulary Definitions</a> will have a JSON key representation.</p>

<p>In addition,
<span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-string-type">
Thing Description instances MAY contain JSON-LD 1.1 keys such as <code>@context</code> and <code>@type</code>.</span></p>

<!--<p>JSON TD MAY contain vocabulary terms that are not in the Thing Description core model. These vocabulary terms MUST carry a prefix for identification within the key name (e.g., "http:header").</p>-->

<p>The defined types of the vocabulary as defined in <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definitions" class="sec-ref">Vocabulary Definitions</a> will be transformed to JSON-based types. The following rules are used for vocabulary terms based on simple type definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-string-type">
        Vocabulary terms that use simple types string and anyURI
        MUST be serialized as JSON string.
    </span></li>

<li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-integer-type">
        Vocabulary terms that use simple type unsignedInt
        MUST be serialized as JSON integer.
    </span></li>

<li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-number-type">
        Vocabulary terms that use simple type double
        MUST be serialized as JSON number.
    </span></li>
</ul>

<p>All vocabulary terms in <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definitions" class="sec-ref">Vocabulary Definitions</a> Section associated with complex-/class-based types are defined separately for structured JSON type transformation in the following subsections.</p>


  <section id="sec-thing-as-a-whole-json">
    <h2>Thing as a whole</h2>

<p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-context">
In the first line of the Thing Description instance MAY include the <code>@context</code> key from JSON-LD 1.1 with the value URI of the Thing description context file <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/td</code>.
</span></p>



  <pre class="example">
    {
      "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/td",
      ...
    }
  </pre>

<p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-context-jsonld">
In the case the Thing Description instance is processed and interpret by a JSON-LD 1.1 processor this <code>@context</code> with its value MUST be present</span> (also see Section <a href="#note-jsonld-processing" class="sec-ref">JSON-LD 1.1 Processing</a>). </span></p>

<p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-additional-contexts">
In case a single Thing Description instance involves several contexts, additional namespaces with prefixes MUST be extended to the <code>@context</code> array structure.</span> 
This option proves relevant if one wants to extend the existing Thing Description context without modifying it. For instance:
</p>
  <pre class="example">
    {
      "@context": ["http://www.w3.org/ns/td",
                   {"sensor": "http://iotschema.org/"}],
      ...
    }
  </pre>



<p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-context-toplevel">
Each mandatory and optional vocabulary, as defined in the class <a href="#thing" class="sec-ref">Thing</a>, MUST be serialized as a JSON key at the top level of the Thing Description instance.</span></p>

<p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-objects">
The type of the fields <code>properties</code>, <code>actions</code>, and <code>events</code> MUST be serialized as a JSON object.</span></p>

<p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-arrays">
The type of the field <code>links</code> and <code>security</code> MUST be serialized as a JSON array.</span></p>

<p>An example of a TD snippet based on the defined fields of the <a href="#thing" class="sec-ref">Thing</a> information model without the optional field <code>@context</code> is given below:</p>

  <pre class="example">
        {
          "id": "urn:dev:wot:com:example:servient:myThing",
          "name": "MyThing",
          "description": "Additional (human) readable information of the Thing.",
          "support": "https://servient.example.com/contact",
          "security": [...],
          "base": "https://servient.example.com/",
          "properties": {...},
          "actions": {...},
          "events": {...},
          "links": [...]
        }
   </pre>


<p>In addition, the same example can also include the (semantic) keys of JSON-LD 1.1 (<code>@context</code> and <code>@type</code>):</p>

  <pre class="example">
        {
          "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/td",
          "@type": "Thing",
          "id": "urn:dev:wot:com:example:servient:myThing",
          "name": "MyThing",
          "description": "Additional (human) readable information of the Thing.",
          "support": "https://servient.example.com/contact",
          "security": [...],
          "base": "https://servient.example.com/",
          "properties": {...},
          "actions": {...},
          "events": {...},

    Each mandatory and optional vocabulary, as defined in the class <a href="#security" class="sec-ref">SecurityScheme</a>, MUST be serialized as a JSON key.</span></p>

      <p>The following TD snippet example shows a simple security configuration specifying
      basic authentication in the header.  The value of <code>in</code> given is actually the default
      value.</p>
      <pre class="example">
"security": [
  {
    "scheme": "basic",
    "in": "header"
  }
]

      <p>Here is a more complex example: a TD snippet showing digest authentication on a proxy
      combined with bearer token authentication on an endpoint.  Here the default
      value of <code>in</code> in the <code>digest</code> scheme is implied.</p>
      <pre class="example">
...
"security": [
  {
    "scheme": "digest",
    "proxyUrl": "https://portal.example.com/"
  },
  {
    "scheme": "bearer",
    "format": "jwt",
    "alg": "ES256",
    "authorizationUrl": "https://servient.example.com:8443/"
  }
]
      </pre>

      <p>Security definitions can be given at more than one level.
      In this case, definitions at the lower levels override (completely replace)
      the definitions at the higher level.  
      </p>

      <p>
      Security configuration is mandatory. 
      <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-security-mandatory">
      Every form in a Thing MUST have a security configuration either provided in the form itself,
      at the interaction level directly above it (if security is not configured in the form), or at the Thing level 
      (if security is not configured in either the form or at the interaction level).
      </span>
      In the vocabulary tables above, note that <code>security</code> is marked as non-mandatory.
      However, this is only true locally (at a specific level), and only if the security is configured at a higher or
      lower level.  In other words, a security
      configuration must be provided at <em>some</em> level for each form.
      </p>
      <p>
      Security configuration is considered binding.
      <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-security-binding">
      The security configuration metadata provided in a Thing Description MUST accurately reflect the
      security requirements of the Thing.
      </span>  
      Some protocols can ask for authentication dynamically.  If a protocol asks for
      a form of security credentials not declared in the Thing Description then the Thing Description
      is to be considered invalid.
      <p>
      The <code>none</code> security scheme is provided for the case that no security is needed.
      The minimal security configuration for a Thing is configuration of the <code>none</code> security scheme 
      at the top level, as in the following example:
      <pre class="example">
        {
          "name": "MyThing",
          "id": "urn:dev:wot:com:example:servient:myThing",
          "base": "https://servient.example.com/",
          "description": "Additional (human) readable information of the Thing.",
          "support": "https://servient.example.com/contact",
	  "security": [{"scheme": "none"}],
          "properties": {...},
          "actions": {...},
          "events": {...},
          "links": [...]
        }
      </pre>
      </p> 

      <p>
      To give a more complex example, suppose we have a Thing where all interactions
      require basic authentication except for one interaction in which
      security has been overridden.  In the following, the <code>none</code> scheme for
      the security configuration in the <code>overheating</code> event to indicate no 
      authentication is required.  For the <code>status</code> property and the <code>toggle</code>
      action, however, <code>basic</code> authentication is required, as defined
      at the top level of the Thing.
      <pre class="example">
{
  ...
  "security": [{"scheme": "basic"}],
  "properties": {
    "status": {
      ...
      "forms": [{
        "href": "https://mylamp.example.com/status",
        "mediaType": "application/json",
      }]
    }
  },
  "actions": {
    "toggle": {
      ...
      "forms": [{
        "href": "https://mylamp.example.com/toggle",
        "mediaType": "application/json"
      }]
    }
  },
  "events": {
    "overheating": {
      ...
      "forms": [{
        "href": "https://mylamp.example.com/oh",
        "mediaType": "application/json",
	"security": [{"scheme": "none"}] 
      }]
    }
  }
}
      </pre>
      </p>

      <p>Security definitions can also can be given for different elements
      at the same level.  This may be required for devices that support
      multiple protocols, for example CoAP and HTTP, with support for different
      security mechanisms.  This is also useful when alternative authentication
      mechanisms are allowed.  Here is a TD snippet demonstrating three possible
      ways to access a resource: via HTTPS with basic authentication, via HTTPS
      via digest authentication, or via CoAPS with an API key.
      In other words, the use of multiple security configurations at the same level 
      provides a way to combine security mechanisms an in "OR" fashion.
      In contrast, putting multiple security configurations in the same
      <code>security</code> field combines them in an "AND" fashion, since in that case
      they would all need to be satisfied to allow access to the resource.
      <pre class="example">
"properties": {
  "status": {
    ...
    "forms": [
      {
        "href": "https://mylamp.example.com/status",

<h1>Recent Specification Changes</h1>
<h2 id="changes2">Changes from Second Public Working Draft</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The default serialization format for Thing Description is now plain JSON. 
        Thing Description instances still MAY contain JSON-LD keys such as @context and @type for facilitating semantic evaluation of TDs.</li>
    <li>With regards to JSON-LD, this Thing Description draft uses JSON-LD 1.1 instead of JSON-LD 1.0. With this transition, all vocabulary terms defined in vocabulary definition sections now have a JSON key representation.
Previously, there were vocabulary terms represented as key values in TDs.</li>
    <li>Added a section about media types used for exchanging TDs.</li>
    <li>Added a section about implementation notes that provide useful clarifications to implementors.</li>
    <li>A JSON Schema is provided in the appendix section "JSON Schema for TD Instance Validation" to facilitate the validation of Thing Description instances.</li>
    <li>Some vocabulary terms (e.g. writable, observable, mediaType) now have default values that are used by Thing Description processors when they are absent in TD instances.</li>
    <li>In addition to core Thing Description vocabulary, Thing Description now has the data schema vocabulary reflecting a subset of JSON Schema terms as linked data representation and the security vocabulary for defining security based conditions.</li>
    <li>Thing has a mandatory field "id" for uniquely identifying a Thing, and an optional field "support" to provide information about Thing Description maintainer.</li>
    <li>Interaction patterns have an optional "label" field providing text for such as user interfaces.</li>
    <li>A security field was introduced, and are available at three levels (i.e. Thing, Interaction Patterns and Forms) for providing security conditions in accessing resources.</li>
  </ul>
