  <section id="abstract">
This document describes a formal model and common representation for a Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description. A Thing Description describes the metadata and interfaces of Things, where a Thing is an abstraction of a physical entity that provides interactions to and participates in the Web of Things. Thing Descriptions provide a narrow-waist set of interactions based on a small vocabulary that makes it possible both to integrate diverse devices and to allow diverse applications to interoperate. Thing Descriptions, by default, are encoded in JSON-LD. JSON-LD provides both a powerful foundation to represent knowledge about Things and simplicity, since it allows processing as a JSON document. In addition to physical entities, Things can also represent virtual entities. A Thing Description instance can be hosted by the Thing itself or hosted externally due to Thing's resource restrictions (e.g. limited memory space) or when a Web of Things-compatible legacy device is retrofitted with a Thing Description.

<!-- for devices.
The TD must be acquired to use and interact with the Thing, since it describes the semantics of a Thing as well as its <a>WoT Interface</a>. Usually, Things directly provide their own TD, but the TD can also be hosted externally if there is not enough space on the device or when a WoT-compatible legacy device is retrofitted with a TD.-->

  <section id="introduction">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
The W3C Thing Description (TD) is a central building block in a Web of Things (WoT) enabled system and can be considered as the entry point of a Thing (aka the <i>index.html</i> of the Thing). The TD consists of semantic metadata for the Thing itself, a narrow-waist interaction model with WoT's Properties, Actions, and Events, a semantic schema to make data models machine-understandable, and features for Web Linking to express relations among Things. 
</p>
<p>
Properties can be used for controlling (or retrieving) parameters, such as a setting an operation state (or getting the current value). Actions model invocation of physical processes, but can also be used to abstract RPC-like calls of existing platforms. Events cover the push model where state change notifications, discrete events, and streams of values are sent asynchronously to the receiver. In general, the TD provides metadata for the different communication bindings (e.g., HTTP, CoAP, MQTT, etc.), mediaTypes (e.g., "application/json", "application/xml", "application/cbor", "application/exi" etc.), and security policies (authentication, authorization, etc.). The default serialisation of the TD is JSON-LD.
</p>

<p>
Example 1 shows a simple TD instance that reflects WoT's Property, Action, Event paradigm by describing a lamp Thing with the name <i>MyLampThing</i>.
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Simple Thing Description Sample">
  {
    "@context": ["https://w3c.github.io/wot/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld"],
    "@type": ["Thing"],
    "name": "MyLampThing",
    "interaction": [
        {
            "@type": ["Property"],
            "name": "status",
            "schema": {"type": "string"},
            "writable": false,
            "observable": true,
            "form": [{
                "href": "coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/status",
                "mediaType": "application/json"
            }]
        },
        {
            "@type": ["Action"],
            "name": "toggle",
            "form": [{
                "href": "coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/toggle",
                "mediaType": "application/json"
            }]
        },
        {
            "@type": ["Event"],
            "name": "overheating",
            "schema": {"type": "string"},
            "form": [{
                "href": "coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/oh",
                "mediaType": "application/json"
            }]
        }
    ]
  }
 </pre>




<p>Based on this content, we know there exists one Property interaction resource with the name <i>status</i>. In addition, information is provided such as that this Property is accessable over the CoAP protocol with a GET method (see CoAP protocol binding description in the W3C WoT protocol template deliverable [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]]) at coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/status (announced within the <code>form</code> structure by the <code>href</code> key), which will return a string status value within a JSON structure (JSON as payload format is announced by the <code>mediaType</code> field).
</p>

<p>In a similar manner an Action is specified to toogle the switch status using the POST method that is applied to the coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/toggle resource (see CoAP protocol binding description in the W3C WoT protocol template deliverable [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]]).</p>

<p>Events which are, e.g., unexpected or irregular can be specified with the WoT's Event model. Here, a subscription of a possible overheating event of the lamp can be applied by using CoAP OBSERVE at coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/oh. (see CoAP protocol binding description in the W3C WoT protocol template deliverable [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]]).
</p>

<section id="intro-semantics"> 
<h1>Context Extensions</h1>
<p>The Thing Description defines a relative small set of terms to describe mainly Thing's interaction models. However, the TD opens the re-usage of existing models from un-specific (e.g., schema.org, SSN) and specific domains (e.g., smart home, consumer electronics, industry, automotive) to enrich the capabilities of a Thing with further vocabulary and semantics.</p>

<p>The following example extends the previous shown Example with further semantics from the iotschema.org context.</p>

<pre class="example" title="Sample with semantic extenstions">
  {
    "@context": ["https://w3c.github.io/wot/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld", 
            {"iot": "http://iotschema.org/"}],
    "@type": ["Thing",  "iot:Light", "iot:BinarySwitch"],
    "name": "MyLampThing",
    "interaction": [
        {
            "@type": ["Property", "iot:SwitchStatus"],
            "name": "status",
            "schema": {"type": "string"},
            "writable": false,
            "observable": true,
            "form": [{
                "href": "coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/status",
                "mediaType": "application/json"
            }]
        },
        {
            "@type": ["Action", "iot:ChangeSwitchStatus"],
            "name": "toggle",
            "form": [{
                "href": "coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/toggle",
                "mediaType": "application/json"
            }]
        },
        {
            "@type": ["Event", "iot:TemperatureExceed"],
            "name": "overheating",
            "schema": {"type": "string"},
            "form": [{
                "href": "coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/oh",
                "mediaType": "application/json"

When a concrete Property, Action or Event is defined in a Thing Description, it is called an &quot;interaction resource&quot;. Interactions between Things can be as simple as one Thing accessing another Thing&#39;s data to get or (in the case the data is also writable) change representation of data such as metadata, status or mode. A Thing may also be interested in getting asynchronously notified of future changes in another Thing, or may want to initiate a process served in another Thing that may take some time to complete and monitor the progress. Interactions between Things may involve exchanges of data between them. This data can be either given as input by the client Thing, returned as output by the server Thing or both.  </p><table class="def"><thead><tr><th>Field Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Expected value type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>form</code></td><td>Indicates one or more endpoints from which an interaction pattern is accessible</td><td><a href="#form"><code>Form</code></a></td></tr><tr><td><code>name</code></td><td>Name of the Thing or interaction pattern (must be a valid keyword to be used in the scripting API)</td><td><a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"><code>string</code></a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The class <code>InteractionPattern</code> has the following subclasses:</p><ul><li><td><a href="#action"><code>Action</code></a></td></li><li><td><a href="#event"><code>Event</code></a></td></li><li><td><a href="#property"><code>Property</code></a></td></li></ul><h3><code>Property</code></h3><p>Property provides readable and/or writeable data that can be static (e.g., supported mode, rated output voltage, etc.) or dynamic (e.g., current fill level of water, minimum recorded temperature, etc.).

    <h1>JSON-LD Serialization</h1>

<p>
  Thing Description instances are modeled on the classes defined in <a href="#vocabularyDefinitionSection" class="sec-ref"></a>, and they are serialized in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a> by default, using the vocabulary defined there when they are served at run-time.
  JSON-LD is a serialization format that adds a semantic layer on top of the JSON specification: the terms that appear in a JSON document
  should be associated with uniquely identified concepts from shared vocabularies. This principle is part of a set of practices to publish data
  on the Web called Linked Data, where concepts are usually identified with URIs and originate from RDF vocabularies.
</p>

      <!-- p class="ednote">Currently, JSON-LD is seen as baseline for TD serialization. In TD task force alternatives are evaluated.
      </p -->

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Each field in Thing class (see <a href="#thing" class="sec-ref"></a>) is represented by the namesake JSON field described in the above table.
      </p>

<p>
The  <code>@context</code> key is used to define Thing Description's context. All JSON key terms that are defined in the present document (also see <a href="#vocabularyDefinitionSection">Vocabulary Definition Section</a> ) have been put in an external context document, available at
  <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/td/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld</code>. Each Thing Description instance in JSON-LD MUST have this context information enmbedded within an JSON array structure. Thus, a basic Thing Description would contain the following declaration:
</p>

  <pre class="example">
    {
      "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/td/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld"],
      ...
    }
  </pre>

<p>
  In case a single Thing Description instance involves several contexts, additional namespaces with prefixes can be extended to the <code>@context</code> array structure. This option proves relevant if one wants to extend the existing Thing Description context without modifying it. For instance:
</p>
  <pre class="example">
    {
      "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/td/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld",
                   {"sensor": "http://example.org/sensors#"}],
      ...
    }
  </pre>

      <!-- p>A Thing Description will provide some generic Thing metadata vocabularies (also see <a href="#thing">Thing vocabulary definition section</a>) that can be used, e.g., 
      to assign a name or what kind of base URI does a servient support.</p -->

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Besides these pre-defined terms in the Thing Description context, additional characteristics can be
        added to Thing level such as product ID, firmware version, location, etc. These terms should then appear in the context of the Thing <!-- (as detailed in <a href="#td-context"></a>) -->.
      </p>

      <p class="ednote">This note should be moved to the td-context-extension definition once we have a section for that. In there it should be also explained that a context is not necessary if you are working outside of the RDF model and if you handle a TD just as a simple JSON document.
      </p>

<p>
A sample TD snippet that relies on the defined fields above is given below:
</p>
  <pre class="example">
        {
          "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/td/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld"],
          "@type": ["Thing"],
          "name": "MyThing",
          "base": "coap://mything.example.com:5683/",

    <h1>Interaction Resources</h1>

    <p>
      An interaction in the context of the Web of Things is an exchange of data between a Web client and a Thing.
      This data can be either given as input by the client, returned as output by the Thing, or both.
      Three interaction patterns are defined: 
      <a href="#property-serialization">Property</a>, 
      <a href="#action-serialization">Action</a>, and 
      <a href="#event-serialization">Event</a>.
    </p>

      <h3>Property</h3>
  
      <p>
        The <code>Property</code> interaction definitions (also see <a href="#property">Property vocabulary definition section</a>) provides metadata for readable and/or writeable data that can be static (e.g., supported mode, rated output voltage, etc.) or 
        dynamic (e.g., current fill level of water, minimum recorded temperature, etc.).

      <h3>Action</h3>
  
      <p>
        The <code>Action</code> interaction pattern (also see <a href="#action">Action vocabulary definition section</a>) targets changes or processes on a Thing that take a certain time to complete (i.e., actions cannot be applied instantaneously like property writes).
        Examples include an LED fade in, moving a robot, brewing a cup of coffee, etc.
        Usually, ongoing Actions are modeled as Task resources, which are created when an Action invocation is received by the Thing.

  <section>
    <h1 id="type-system-section">Type System</h1>

    <p>All three interaction types, <code>Property</code>, <code>Action</code>, and <code>Event</code>, include data schema definitions. Instances of the <code>Property</code> and <code>Event</code> interaction types each must define only one schema (i.e. <code>schema</code> field), which describes the data they expose, while instances of the <code>Action</code> interaction type can define different schemas for inputs (i.e. <code>inputSchema</code>) and outputs (i.e. <code>outputSchema</code>). In the case of a <code>Property</code> that allows for an update operation, the input data and the output data are defined by a single schema (<code>schema</code> field).

   <p>
	In this section, we define an abstract type system notation based on JSON-LD for describing the structure and datatypes for values of interaction types. While type system is designed to be compatible with JSON schema [[JSON-SCHEMA-CORE]] [[JSON-SCHEMA-VALIDATION]], it is intended to be encoding-neutral and integrates into the Linked Data vocabularies to allow semantic annotations. It can not only be directly translated into JSON schema, but also can be handily translated into XML Schema. Use of JSON-LD equips the type system with a way to associate data elements with citations and semantic concepts defined elsewhere.

    <section>
      <h4 id="simple-type-list">Simple Types</h4>

	<p>Within <code>schema</code>, <code>inputSchema</code> and <code>outputSchema</code> fields, simple type assignments can be done by using the <code>type</code> field that specifies one of the datatypes borrowed from [[JSON-SCHEMA-VALIDATION]]. Shown below is an example of an interaction snippet that carries a simple type definition <code>number</code> within <code>schema</code>.  

    <pre class="example">
            "schema": { "type": "number" }
    </pre>

JSON-LD representation for primitive data type definition is a JSON object of which the field is defined below.

      <table class="def">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field Name</th>
            <th>JSON Construct</th>
            <th>Mandatory</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>type</td>
            <td>string</td>
            <td>yes</td>
            <td><p>The following type defintions are possible for simple type assignments:
	      <ul>
		<li>boolean</li>
		<li>integer</li>
		<li>number</li>
		<li>string</li>
		<li>null</li>
	      </ul>
		</p>
	   </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>


    <p>These type constructs are in parallel to those that are available in JSON schema. Therefore, serialization of data exchanged between servients is straightforward when it is in JSON format.
    </p>
    </section>
    

    <section>
      <h4 id="type-restriction">Restrictions</h4>
  <p>In order to make more precise data type defintions the TD also allows the usage of restrication terms borrowed from [[JSON-SCHEMA-VALIDATION]]. Consider the following <code>schema</code> definition which defines the value to be an <code>integer</code> within the value range of [ 0 ... 255 ].
      </p>

      <pre class="example">
        "schema": { 
          "type": "integer",
          "minimum": 0,
          "maximum": 255

      <h4>Semantic Annotation</h4>

<p>Unlike in JSON Schema, the TD with JSON-LD serializiation allows a semantic annotation of data members of the types by using the <code>@type</code> key. The example below comes with a semantic annotation within <code>inputSchema</code> to privide its semantic context <i>DimmerData</i> that is defined in the <i>http://iotschema.org/</i> namespace.
</p>

      <pre class="example">
        {
          "@context": [
            "https://w3c.github.io/wot/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld", 
            {"iot": "http://iotschema.org/"}
          ],
          ...
          "inputSchema": { 
            "type": "integer",
            "@type": ["iot:DimmerData" ],
            "minimum": 0,
            "maximum": 255,
          },
          ...
        }

      <h4>Runtime Data Serializiation</h4>

<p>Unless otherwise specified in the <code>form</code> field (also see [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]]) the provided schema reflects the payload structure of the runtime data of the <code>Property</code>, <code>Action</code>, and <code>Event</code>. </p>

      <p>Let's consider the simple data type defintion as shown in Example 11. When the <code>integer</code> being exchanged is 184, data serialization in JSON format will look like the following:
      </p>

      <pre class="example">
        184
      </pre>

      <p>The snippet in the above example is a valid JSON document according to the syntax defined in [[!RFC7159]], which allows sending simple types in the root of the document. There is no need for wrapping a single value into an object.
      </p>

      <p>The same data (i.e. a number equal to 184) will look like the following when the data is exchanged in XML.
      </p>

      <pre class="example">
      		&lt;integer>184&lt;/integer>
      </pre>
    </section>
    </section>
  
    <section>
      <h4 id="structure-data-section">Structured Data Definition</h4>
 
	
      <p>With the type system, it is also possible to define value types that have more than one literal value.
      The type system provides two distinct constructs to define a structure that can have multiple literal values. 
      One is the <code>object</code>, and the other one is the <code>array</code>. Both <code>object</code> and <code>array</code> are assigned as the value of <code>type</code> field in order to indicate the use of those constructs.
      </p>



      <section>
        <h5 id="type-system-object">Object</h5>


	<p>In order to avoid duplicate key definitions with different meanings in the context documents, <code>object</code> definitions take a form that is slightly different from that of [[JSON-SCHEMA-VALIDATION]]. The following highlights the differences.
	      <ul>
		<li>TD uses a JSON array with a name <code>field</code> instead of JSON Schema's <i>properties</i> of a JSON object</li>

		<li>Each object in a <code>field</code> array must contain the key <code>name</code> (corresponding to the field name of the specified JSON object), and <code>schema</code>, whose value must be a data schema as specified in the present section (recursive definition)</li>
	      </ul>
	</p>

<p>The following example shows a Thing Description <code>object</code> definiton using JSON-LD serializiation, in comparison with an equivalent JSON Schema object definition.

        <h5>Runtime Data Serializiation</h5>

 	<p>In the case of an object-based schema decleration the expected instance is straightforward and similar handling to JSON Schema and JSON instances. Let's consider Example 18: When the <code>brightness</code> number and the <code>name</code> string values being exchanged are 200 and "Web of Things", data serialization in JSON format will look like the following.
        </p>
    
        <pre class="example">
          {
            "brightness": 200,
            "name": "Web of Things"
          }
        </pre>
    
        <p>The above data will look the following when the data is exchanged in XML.
        </p>
    
        <pre class="example">
            &lt;object>
              &lt;id>
                &lt;integer>200&lt;/integer>
              &lt;/id>
              &lt;name>
                &lt;string>Web of Things&lt;/string>
              &lt;/name>
            &lt;/object>
        </pre>

        <p>In both JSON and XML serialization, values can appear in any order regardless of the order used in the <code>field</code> definition of the <code>object</code>.
        </p>




   
        <p>In the case of an array decleration there is the same bahavior from JSON Schema and JSON instances. Let's consider Example 19: When the numbers being exchanged are 520, 184 and 1314, data serialization in JSON format will look like the following.
        </p>
    
        <pre class="example">
          [
            520,
            184,
            1314
          ]
        </pre>
    
        <p>The above data will look the following when the data is exchanged in XML.
        </p>
    
        <pre class="example">
            &lt;array>

    <h4>Mapping to XML Schema</h4>

      <p>In the previous section, examples showed what data whose value type is described using the type system
      look like when serialized to XML in parallel to corresponding JSON serializations.
      </p>

      <p>This section describes how type definitions described using the type system can be mapped to XML schema definitions by using the same examples.
      Given these type definitions, providing the mapping to XML schema allows XML tools to directly validate serialized XML data, for example.

      <h5>Object Definition to XML Schema</h5>

      <p>Shown below is the type system <code>object</code> definition given for the <code>inputSchema</code> in Section <a href="#type-system-object">Object</a>. The <code>object</code> consists of two named literals <code>id</code> (of type <code>integer</code>) and <code>name</code> (of type <code>string</code>) where <code>id</code> is required to be present.
      </p>

      <pre class="example">
        {
            "type": "object",
            "field": [
                {
                    "name": "id",
                    "schema": {
                      "type": "integer"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "name": "name",
                    "schema": {
                      "type": "string"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "required": ["id"]
        }
      </pre>

      <p>When the <code>object</code> is anonymous (i.e. it is the root, or participates in an <code>array</code> definition), 
      the above <code>object</code> definition transforms to the following XML Schema element definition.
      </p>

    <h2>Parsing</h2>
<p>
To parse a valid Thing Description a simple JSON-based parser and tools can be used to retrieve the content. To validate and follow references to external context vocabulary, JSON-LD or RDF-based parsing tools and libraries are highly recommended.

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <p>
      In the following, we give examples of full TDs. The first one, a
      temperature sensor, shows how to define relations between Thing
      Properties. As a second example, we modeled
      an actuator (LED lamp) where Actions have all been characterized semantically,
      so that machines could unambiguously interpret them in an automated manner.
      At last, association between Things is shown by defining a master switch
      controlling other LED lamps.

      <p>
        The Thing <code>myTempSensor</code> defines two Properties: <code>myTemp</code>
        and <code>myThreshold</code>. Both are defined as temperatures, with the same unit
        (<code>celsius</code>). A client that is able to parse a TD only needs to know
        the predicate <code>reference</code> to understand that the threshold acts as
        a reference value for <code>myTemp</code> while the latter is the actual
        value measured by the temperature sensor. Here, <code>reference</code> points
        to <code>http://schema.org/valueReference</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, one of the Events of the Thing is linked to the measured value
        (with the predicate <code>property</code>). It means
        in that context that an event should be triggered each time <code>myTemp</code>
        changes. The other Event does not define further semantics. It could be used either
        in a closed system (where clients are aware of its meaning) or by a human but
        an external agent would not have sufficient information to interpret it.

      <p class="ednote"> 
       In this last example, it would be good to illustrate the use of <code>associations</code>.
        The Thing we modeled here acts as a master switch for eight lamps similar
        to that of <a href="#led-actuator"></a>. This means switching on and off
        <code>myMasterOnOff</code> will propagate to all associated Things
        by toggling their Action that is also of type <code>Toggle</code>.
        No precise semantics for <code>associations</code> have been defined yet
        and there might exist many other kinds of dependency between Things than
        simply parent/child relations. This issue will be addressed soon. Until then,
        Thing associations could be useful for discovery.
