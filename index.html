  <p>
  This document describes a formal model and a common representation 
  for a Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description. 
  A Thing Description describes the metadata and interfaces of Things, 
  where a Thing is an abstraction of a physical or virtual entity that 
  provides interactions to and participates in the Web of Things. 
  Thing Descriptions provide a set of interactions based on a small vocabulary 
  that makes it possible both to integrate diverse devices and 
  to allow diverse applications to interoperate. 
  Thing Descriptions, by default, are encoded in JSON-LD. 
  JSON-LD provides both a powerful foundation to represent knowledge 
  about Things and simplicity, 
  since it allows processing as a JSON document. 
  A Thing Description instance can be hosted by the Thing itself or hosted 
  externally when a Thing has resource restrictions (e.g., limited memory space) 
  or when a Web of Things-compatible legacy device is retrofitted 
  with a Thing Description.

  <section id="introduction">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
  The W3C Thing Description (TD) is a central building block in a Web of Things 
  (WoT) enabled system and can be considered as the entry point of a Thing 
  (much like the <i>index.html</i> of a web site). 
  The TD consists of semantic metadata for the Thing itself,
  an interaction model based on WoT's <code>Properties</code>,
  <code>Actions</code>, and <code>Events</code> paradigm, 
  a semantic schema to make data models machine-understandable, 
  and features for Web Linking to express relations among Things. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Properties can be used for controlling (or retrieving) parameters, 
  such as a setting an operation state (or getting the current value). 
  Actions model invocation of physical processes, 
  but can also be used to abstract RPC-like calls of existing platforms. 
  Events are used for interactions that use the push model of
  communication where state change notifications, 
  discrete events, 
  and streams of values are sent asynchronously to the receiver. 
  In general, the TD provides metadata for different communication bindings 
  (e.g., HTTP, CoAP, MQTT, etc.), 
  mediaTypes (e.g., "application/json", "application/xml", "application/cbor", 
  "application/exi" etc.), 
  and security mechanisms (for authentication, authorization, 
  confidentiality, etc.). 
  Serialization of TD instances is based on JSON and includes at least 
  the TD core vocabulary as JSON keys as defined in this specification document.
  </p>
  <p>
  Example 1 shows a simple TD instance in such a JSON serializiation that 
  reflects WoT's <code>Properties</code>, <code>Actions</code>, 
  and <code>Events</code> paradigm 
  by describing a lamp Thing with the name <i>MyLampThing</i>.
  </p>
<pre id="simple-thing-description-sample" 
     class="example" title="Simple Thing Description Sample with JSON serialization">
{
    "id": "urn:dev:wot:com:example:servient:lamp",
    "name": "MyLampThing",
    "security": [{"scheme": "basic"}],
    "properties": {
        "status" : {
            "type": "string",
            "forms": [{"href": "https://mylamp.example.com/status"}]
        }
    },
    "actions": {
        "toggle" : {
            "forms": [{"href": "https://mylamp.example.com/toggle"}]
        }
    },
    "events":{
        "overheating":{
            "type": "string",
            "forms": [{"href": "https://mylamp.example.com/oh"}]
        }
    }
}
</pre>
  <p>
  Based on this content, 
  we know there exists one <code>Property</code> interaction resource 
  with the name <i>status</i>. 
  In addition, 
  information is provided to indicate that this Property is accessible via 
  (the secure form of) the HTTP protocol with a GET method 
  at the URI <code>https://mylamp.example.com/status</code> 
  (announced within the <code>forms</code> structure by the 
  <code>href</code> key), and will return a string status value.
  The use of the GET method is not stated explicitly but is 
  the default assumption made by the W3C WoT 
  protocol template deliverable [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]].
  </p>
  <p>
  In a similar manner an <code>Action</code> is specified to toggle the 
  switch status using the POST method applied to the 
  <code>https://mylamp.example.com/toggle</code> resource 
  (see again the HTTP protocol binding description in the W3C WoT protocol 
  template deliverable [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]]).
  </p>
  <p>
  The WoT's <code>Event</code> model enables a mechanism for events to be 
  notified by a Thing. 
  Here, a subscription to be notified upon a possible overheating event 
  of the lamp can be obtained by using the default event-handling mechanism 
  defined in the protocol binding for HTTP at 
  <code>https://mylamp.example.com/oh</code> 
  (see again the HTTP protocol binding description in the W3C WoT protocol 
  template deliverable [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]]).
  </p>
  <p>
  This example also specifies the <code>basic</code> security scheme, 
  requiring a username and password for access.
  In combination with the use of the HTTP protocol this indicates the use of 
  HTTP Basic Authentication.
  Specification of a security scheme at the top level as in this example 
  indicates that it is required for every resource.
  However, security schemes can also be specified per-interaction or per-form,
  with lower-level configurations overriding higher-level ones,
  allowing for the specification of fine-grained access control.
  Examples are provided later.
  </p>
  <p>
  The TD in Example 1 reflects some additional defined default assumptions 
  that are not explicitly described. 
  For example, the media type of the 
  exchange format of the interactions is assumed to be JSON 
  (=<code>mediaType</code>) and the <code>Property</code> <i>status</i> 
  resource is not writable as well as not observable. 
  Specifically, 
  the TD specification defines vocabulary terms 
  (<code>writable</code>, <code>observable</code>, <code>mediaType</code>) 
  that have default values. 
  If these vocabulary terms are not explicitly used in a Thing Description 
  instance, 
  the Thing Description processor follows default assumptions for 
  interpretation as defined in this specification.
  </p>
  <p>
  The TD can be also processed as an RDF-based model. 
  In that case, the Thing Description instance can be transformed 
  into valid JSON-LD first.  
  In terms of JSON-LD 1.1 serialization, 
  RDF semantic processing's open-world assumption requires vocabulary terms 
  with default values to be always present explicitly in the instances. 
  Example 2 shows the same TD in a JSON-LD 1.1 serializiation representing
  exactly the same information as in Example 1; however, default values
  have been filled in.

Interactions between Things can be as simple as one Thing accessing another Thing&#39;s data to get or (in the case the data is also writable) change the representation of data such as metadata, status or mode. A Thing may also be interested in getting asynchronously notified of future changes in another Thing, or may want to initiate a process served in another Thing that may take some time to complete and monitor the progress. Interactions between Things may involve exchanges of data between them. This data can be either given as input by the client Thing, returned as output by the server Thing or both.</p><p class="note">Each instance of a <code>Property</code>, <code>Action</code>, and <code>Event</code>  class has a (unique) name.

For the core vocabulary the focus is on well-established security  mechanisms, such as those built into protocols supported by WoT  or already in wide use with those protocols.  Note that the vocabulary extension mechanism of the WoT Thing Description allows for additional security schemes if needed.  The current set of security schemes is partly based on <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#securitySchemeObject">OpenAPI 3.0.1</a>.  The security schemes, vocabulary and syntax given in this specification share many similarities with OpenAPI; however, it is not fully compatible.  Also, as OpenAPI targets only web services built around HTTP it does not cover the full set of use cases required for the IoT.  Therefore, we are currently discussing metadata supporting additional security mechanisms for IoT-centered protocols such as CoAP and MQTT.

  <h1 >Thing Description Serialization</h1>

  <p class="ednote" title="JSON-LD 1.1 ">
  This is the first draft that uses JSON-LD 1.1 as a serialization format 
  of the Thing Description. 
  As this is a work in progress, working assumptions are based on the latest
  <a href="https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/#">Community Draft of JSON-LD 1.1</a>. 
  There is a plan to set up a JSON-LD Working Group with the following 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/03/jsonld-wg-charter.html">JSON-LD Working Group Charter</a>. 
  It is planned that this section will conform to the latest working draft 
  of JSON-LD 1.1.
  </p>

  <p>
  Thing Description instances are modeled and structured based on the 
  <a href="#vocabularyDefinitionSection" class="sec-ref">Thing Description Information Model</a>. 
  This section proposes a TD serialization based on JSON-LD 1.1. 
  </p>

  <section id="json-serializiation-section">
  <h1>Representation Format</h1>

  <p>
  This section introduces the JSON-based serialization of the Thing Description. 
  This serialization also follows the syntax of JSON-LD 1.1 
  in order to streamline the semantic evaluation of TDs.
  </p>

  <p>
  In order to enable this convergence,
  all vocabulary terms defined in 
  <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definitions" class="sec-ref">Vocabulary Definitions</a> 
  will have a JSON key representation.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition,
  <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-string-type">
  Thing Description instances MAY contain JSON-LD 1.1 keys such as 
  <code>@context</code> and <code>@type</code>.</span>
  </p>

  <!--<p>JSON TD MAY contain vocabulary terms that are not in the 
  Thing Description core model. 
  These vocabulary terms MUST carry a prefix for identification 
  within the key name (e.g., "http:header").</p>-->

  <p>
  The defined types of the vocabulary as defined in 
  <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definitions" class="sec-ref">Vocabulary Definitions</a> 
  will be transformed to JSON-based types. 
  The following rules are used for vocabulary terms based on some simple type 
  definitions:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-string-type">
        Vocabulary terms that use simple types string and anyURI
        MUST be serialized as JSON string.
  </span></li>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-integer-type">
        Vocabulary terms that use simple type unsignedInt
        MUST be serialized as JSON integer.
  </span></li>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-number-type">
        Vocabulary terms that use simple type double
        MUST be serialized as JSON number.
  </span></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  All vocabulary terms in the
  <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definitions" class="sec-ref">Vocabulary Definitions</a> Section 
  associated with more complex class-based types are defined separately for 
  structured JSON type transformation in the following subsections.

    In the following, the <code>nosec</code> scheme for
    the security configuration in the <code>overheating</code> event

      <p>
      Security definitions can also can be given for different elements
      at the same level.  This may be required for devices that support
      multiple protocols, for example CoAP and HTTP, with support for different
      security mechanisms.  This is also useful when alternative authentication
      mechanisms are allowed.  Here is a TD snippet demonstrating three possible
      ways to access a resource: via HTTPS with basic authentication, via HTTPS
      via digest authentication, or via CoAPS with an API key.
      In other words, 
      the use of multiple security configurations at the same level 
      provides a way to combine security mechanisms an in "OR" fashion.
      In contrast, putting multiple security configurations in the same
      <code>security</code> field combines them in an "AND" fashion,

  To validate the semantic meaning and follow references to external

  as explained in the next sub-section.

  <h2>JSON-LD 1.1 Processing</h2>

  <p>To interpret the semantic meaning of a Thing Description
  in terms of RDF triples, 
  a Thing Description instance first requires a valid JSON-LD 1.1 
  representation based on this Thing Description specification. 
  Then this representation can be passed to a JSON-LD 1.1 interpreter.
  </p>

  <p><!-- The following is not marked as a testable assertion because it 
          simply says the next three are assertions.
          The subassertions have been reworded so they can be understood 
          independently as referring to preprocessing.
          This is why "must" is in lower case.  -->
  The following pre-processing steps of a Thing Description instance 
  must be executed before starting JSON-LD 1.1 based processing:
  <ul>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-jsonld-preprocessing-context">
     Before starting JSON-LD 1.1 processing of a Thing Description instance,
     there MUST be a <code>@context</code> key from JSON-LD 1.1 as defined 
     in Section 
     <a href="#sec-thing-as-a-whole-json" class="sec-ref">Thing as a whole</a>.
  </span></li>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-jsonld-preprocessing-prefix">
     Before starting JSON-LD 1.1 processing of a Thing Description instance,
     all external vocabulary terms used in the Thing Description MUST 
     provide their context URIs as prefix or within the <code>@context</code>.
  </span></li>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-jsonld-preprocessing-defaults">
     Before starting JSON-LD 1.1 processing of a Thing Description instance,
     all vocabulary terms that have a default value as defined in the 
     <a href="#vocabularyDefinitionSection">Vocabulary Definition</a> Section
     MUST be present at least with their default value.
  </span></li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <!-- FIX: Actually, the examples in the next section
       are not that good because they
       show semantic annotation in the "output" that is not in the "input"!
       So I have redirected this to examples 1 and 2.

  The 
  <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>  
  Section shows an example of how the input and output of such
  preprocessing would appear.

  <h1>Recent Specification Changes</h1>
  <h2 id="changes2">Changes from Second Public Working Draft</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The default serialization format for Thing Description is now 
        plain JSON. 
        Thing Description instances still MAY contain JSON-LD keys such 
        as @context and @type for facilitating semantic evaluation of TDs.</li>
    <li>With regards to JSON-LD, this Thing Description draft uses JSON-LD 1.1 
        instead of JSON-LD 1.0. With this transition, 
        all vocabulary terms defined in vocabulary definition sections 
        now have a JSON key representation.
        Previously, 
        there were vocabulary terms represented as key values in TDs.</li>
    <li>Added a section about media types used for exchanging TDs.</li>
    <li>Added a section about implementation notes that provide useful 
        clarifications to implementors.</li>
    <li>A JSON Schema is provided in the appendix section 
        "JSON Schema for TD Instance Validation" 
        to facilitate the validation of Thing Description instances.</li>
    <li>Some vocabulary terms (e.g., writable, observable, mediaType) 
        now have default values that are used by Thing Description processors 
        when they are absent in TD instances.  Note that security
        schemes can also have such values.</li>
    <li>In addition to core Thing Description vocabulary, 
        Thing Description now has the data schema vocabulary reflecting a 
        subset of JSON Schema terms as linked data representation and 
        the security vocabulary for defining security based conditions.</li>
    <li>Things now have a mandatory field "id" for uniquely identifying a Thing, 
        and an optional field "support" to provide information about 
        Thing Description maintainer.</li>
    <li>Interaction patterns have an optional "label" field providing text 
        for such uses as user interfaces.</li>
    <li>A security field was introduced, 
        and is available at three levels 
        (Thing, Interaction Patterns and Forms) for providing security 
        requirements for accessing resources.</li>
  </ul>
