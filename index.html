  <p>
  This document describes a formal model and a common representation 
  for a Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description. 
  A Thing Description describes the metadata and interfaces of Things, 
  where a Thing is an abstraction of a physical or virtual entity that 
  provides interactions to and participates in the Web of Things. 
  Thing Descriptions provide a set of interactions based on a small vocabulary 
  that makes it possible both to integrate diverse devices and 
  to allow diverse applications to interoperate. 
  Thing Descriptions, by default, are encoded in a JSON format that also allows
  JSON-LD processing. The latter provides a powerful foundation to represent
  knowledge about Things in a machine-understandable way.
  A Thing Description instance can be hosted by the Thing itself or hosted 
  externally when a Thing has resource restrictions (e.g., limited memory space) 
  or when a Web of Things-compatible legacy device is retrofitted 
  with a Thing Description.

  <section id="introduction">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
  The Thing Description (TD) is a central building block in the W3C Web of
  Things (WoT) and can be considered as the entry point of a Thing
  (much like the <i>index.html</i> of a Web site).
  The TD consists of semantic metadata for the Thing itself,
  an interaction model based on WoT's <code>Properties</code>,
  <code>Actions</code>, and <code>Events</code> paradigm, 
  a semantic schema to make data models machine-understandable, 
  and features for Web Linking to express relations among Things. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Properties can be used for sensing and controlling parameters,
  such as getting the current value or setting an operation state.
  Actions model invocation of physical (and hence time-consuming) processes,
  but can also be used to abstract RPC-like calls of existing platforms. 
  Events are used for the push model of communication where notifications,
  discrete events, or streams of values are sent asynchronously to the receiver.
  In general, the TD provides metadata for different communication bindings 
  identified by URI schemes (e.g., "http", "coap", "mqtt", etc.),
  media types (e.g., "application/json", "application/xml", "application/cbor",
  "application/exi" etc.), and security mechanisms (for authentication,
  authorization, confidentiality, etc.).
  Serialization of TD instances is based on JSON and includes at least 
  the TD core vocabulary as JSON keys as defined in this specification document.
  </p>
  <p>
  Example 1 shows a simple TD instance in such a JSON serializiation and
  depicts WoT's <code>Properties</code>, <code>Actions</code>,
  and <code>Events</code> paradigm 
  by describing a lamp Thing with the name <i>MyLampThing</i>.
  </p>

     class="example" title="Simple Thing Description Sample with JSON serialization">
{
    "id": "urn:dev:wot:com:example:servient:lamp",
    "name": "MyLampThing",
    "security": [{"scheme": "basic"}],
    "properties": {
        "status" : {
            "type": "string",
            "forms": [{"href": "https://mylamp.example.com/status"}]
        }
    },
    "actions": {
        "toggle" : {
            "forms": [{"href": "https://mylamp.example.com/toggle"}]
        }
    },
    "events":{
        "overheating":{
            "data": {"type": "string"},
            "forms": [{
                "href": "https://mylamp.example.com/oh",
                "subprotocol": "longpoll"
            }]
        }
    }
}
</pre>
  <p>
  Based on this content, 
  we know there exists one <code>Property</code> interaction resource 
  with the name <i>status</i>. 
  In addition, 
  information is provided to indicate that this Property is accessible via 
  (the secure form of) the HTTP protocol with a GET method 
  at the URI <code>https://mylamp.example.com/status</code> 
  (announced within the <code>forms</code> structure by the 
  <code>href</code> key), and will return a string status value.
  The use of the GET method is not stated explicitly, 
  but is one of the default assumptions defined by this document.
  </p>
  <p>
  In a similar manner, an <code>Action</code> is specified to toggle the
  switch status using the POST method applied to the 
  <code>https://mylamp.example.com/toggle</code> resource,
  where POST is again a default assumption for invoking Actions.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <code>Event</code> pattern enables a mechanism for asynchronous messages
  to be sent by a Thing.
  Here, a subscription to be notified upon a possible overheating event 
  of the lamp can be obtained by using the HTTP with its long polling
  sub-protocol at <code>https://mylamp.example.com/oh</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
  This example also specifies the <code>basic</code> security scheme, 
  requiring a username and password for access.
  In combination with the use of the HTTP protocol this indicates the use of 
  HTTP Basic Authentication.
  Specification of a security scheme at the top level as in this example 
  indicates that it is required for every resource.
  However, security schemes can also be specified per-interaction or per-form,
  with lower-level configurations overriding higher-level ones,
  allowing for the specification of fine-grained access control.
  Examples are provided later.
  </p>
  <p>
  The TD in Example 1 reflects some additional defined default assumptions 
  that are not explicitly described. 
  For example, the media type of the 
  exchange format of the interactions is assumed to be JSON 
  (=<code>contentType</code>) and the <code>Property</code> <i>status</i> 
  resource is not readOnly as well as not observable. 
  Specifically, 
  the TD specification defines vocabulary terms 
  (<code>readOnly</code>, <code>observable</code>, <code>contentType</code>) 
  that have default values. 
  If these vocabulary terms are not explicitly used in a Thing Description 
  instance, 
  the Thing Description processor follows default assumptions for 
  interpretation as defined in this specification.
  </p>

  <p>
  The TD can be also processed as an RDF-based model. 
  In that case, the Thing Description instance needs to be transformed
  into valid JSON-LD first.  
  In terms of JSON-LD 1.1 serialization, 
  the open-world assumption of RDF semantic processing requires vocabulary terms
  with default values to be always present explicitly in the instances. 
  Example 2 shows the same TD in a JSON-LD 1.1 serializiation representing
  exactly the same information as in Example 1; however, default values
  have been filled in.

  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>Generic WoT terminology is defined in [[!WOT-ARCHITECTURE]]: 
  <dfn data-lt="Things">Thing</dfn>, 
  <dfn data-lt="Thing Descriptions">Thing Description</dfn> 
    (in short <dfn>TD</dfn>), 
  <dfn>Web of Things</dfn> (in short <b><i>WoT</i></b>),  
  <dfn>WoT Interface</dfn> etc.
  </p>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h1>Namespaces</h1>
  <p>
  The namespace for the W3C TD vocabulary as defined in 
  this document is <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/td">http://www.w3.org/ns/td</a>. 
  </p> 
  <p>
  Using content negotiation,  this namespace serves either the TD ontology file (Turtle) 
  or the TD context file (JSON-LD).
  </p>
  <p>
    The suggested prefix for the TD namespace is <code>td</code>.      
  </p>
  <p>
  The security ontology that can be used with the TD 
  is available at 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/wot-security">https://www.w3.org/ns/wot-security</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The data schema ontology that can be used with the TD is 
  available at 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/json-schema">https://www.w3.org/ns/json-schema</a>. 
  </p>

  <p class="ednote" title="Binding Vocabulary and Prefixes">
   The TD will reuse existing vocabulary definitions such as for http from the 
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/http#">http://www.w3.org/2011/http#</a> namespace. In that case the prefix <code>http</code> is used. However, there are prefixes such as
   <code>coap</code> and <code>mqtt</code> which have no namespace yet. Currently there are efforts to have such namespace representations which will be referenced in the 
   TD specification in the future. In the meantime,  the [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]] provides the list of terms that can be used to specify the protocol metadata in the Thing Description.

<section id="sec-vocabulary-definition"><h1>Information Model</h1><!-- h1>Vocabulary</h1 --><section><h2>Overview</h2><p>The W3C Thing Description provides a set of vocabulary for describing physical and virtual Things.

Please note that the figures reflect the vocabulary terms and structure as they would be used in a Thing Description instance (see Section <a href="#sec-td-serialization"></a>).The full ontology definitions of the different modules can be viewed by following the namespaces as provided in Section <a href="#namespaces"></a>.</p><!--<p><a href="http://visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#iri=https://rawgit.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/TD-JSON-LD-1.1/ontology/td.ttl">Click here for the visualization</a></p>--><figure id="td-core-model"><img src="td-core-model/td-core-model.svg" alt="TD core model figure"/><figcaption>TD core model</figcaption></figure><figure id="td-data-schema-model"><img src="td-core-model/td-data-schema-model.svg" alt="TD data schema model figure"/><figcaption>TD data schema model</figcaption></figure><figure id="td-security-model"><img src="td-core-model/td-security-model.svg" alt="TD security model figure"/><figcaption>TD security model</figcaption></figure><p class="ednote" title="Default Values and Mandatory Attributes">In the figures above, and in the tables to follow, items which have default values are indicated as being optional. However, technically, these are optional <em>only in the JSON serialization</em>. They are actually mandatory parts of the information model and are also mandatory in the JSON-LD serialization. In addition, the security scheme configuration is not actually optional even in the JSON serialization.  Security configuration is mandatory at least one of the three levels at which it may be specified... so it can be omitted only if it is specified at a different level for each form.

When a concrete Property, Action or Event is defined in a Thing Description, it is called an &quot;interaction resource&quot;. Interactions between Things can be as simple as one Thing accessing another Thing&#39;s data to get or (in the case the data is also writable) change the representation of data such as metadata, status or mode. A Thing may also be interested in getting asynchronously notified of future changes in another Thing, or may want to initiate a process served in another Thing that may take some time to complete and monitor the progress. Interactions between Things may involve exchanges of data between them. This data can be either given as input by the client Thing, returned as output by the server Thing or both.</p><p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-unique-identifiers">Each instance of a <code>Property</code>, <code>Action</code>, and <code>Event</code> class MUST have an identifier that is unique within the context of a Thing Description document.</span> See Section <a href="#json-serializiation-section" class="sec-ref">Representation Format</a> for more details about JSON-LD 1.1 identifiers.</p><table class="def"><thead><tr><th>Field Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Mandatory</th><th>Default value</th><th>Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>forms</code></td><td>Indicates one or more endpoints from which an interaction pattern is accessible.</td><td>yes</td><td>.</td><td>array of <a href="#form"><code>Form</code></a></td></tr><tr><td><code>title</code></td><td>Provides a human-readable title (e.g., display a text for UI representation) of the interaction pattern.</td><td>no</td><td>.</td><td><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-xmlschema11-2-20120405/#string"><code>string</code></a></td></tr><tr><td><code>uriVariables</code></td><td>Define URI template variables as collection based on DataSchema declarations.</td><td>no</td><td>.</td><td><a href="#dataschema"><code>DataSchema</code></a></td></tr><tr><td><code>description</code></td><td>Provides additional (human-readable) information.</td><td>no</td><td>.</td><td><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-xmlschema11-2-20120405/#string"><code>string</code></a></td></tr><tr><td><code>security</code></td><td>Set of security configurations, provided as an array, that must all be satisfied for access to resources at or below the current level, if not overridden at a lower level.</td><td>no</td><td>.</td><td>array of <a href="#securityscheme"><code>SecurityScheme</code></a></td></tr><tr><td><code>scopes</code></td><td>Set of authorization scope identifiers, provided as an array.

These functions may manipulate the interal state of a Thing in a way that is not possible through setting Properties. Examples are changing internal state that is not exposed as a Property, changing multiple Properties, changing Properties over time or with a process that should not be disclosed. Actions may also be pure functions, that is, they may not use any internal state at all, and may simply process input data and return a result that directly depends only on the input given.</p><table class="def"><thead><tr><th>Field Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Mandatory</th><th>Default value</th><th>Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>input</code></td><td>Used to define the input data schema of the action.</td><td>no</td><td>.</td><td><a href="#dataschema"><code>DataSchema</code></a></td></tr><tr><td><code>output</code></td><td>Used to define the output data schema of the action.</td><td>no</td><td>.</td><td><a href="#dataschema"><code>DataSchema</code></a></td></tr><tr><td><code>safe</code></td><td>Signals if the action is safe (=true) or not.

Here not state, but state transitions (events) are communicated (e.g., &quot;clicked&quot;). Events may be triggered by internal state changes that are not exposed as Properties.

  <section id="sec-td-serialization">
  <h1>Thing Description Serialization</h1>

  <p class="ednote" title="JSON-LD 1.1">
  This is the first draft that uses JSON-LD 1.1 as a serialization format 
  of the Thing Description. 
  As that is work in progress, working assumptions are based on the latest
  <a href="https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/#">Community Draft of JSON-LD 1.1</a>. 
  A new JSON-LD Working Group has already been
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/03/jsonld-wg-charter.html">chartered</a>.
  It is planned that this section will conform to the latest working draft 
  of their JSON-LD 1.1 deliverable and only use stable elements.
  </p>

  <p>
  Thing Description instances are modeled and structured based on Section
  <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definition"></a>.
  This section defines a TD serialization based on JSON [[!RFC8259]].
  </p>

  <section id="json-serializiation-section">
  <h1>Representation Format</h1>

  <p>
  The JSON serialization of TDs follows the syntax of JSON-LD 1.1
  in order to streamline semantic evaluation.
  Hence, serializations can be parsed either as raw JSON or with a JSON-LD 1.1
  processor.
  </p>

  <p>
  In order to enable this convergence,
  all vocabulary terms defined in Section
  <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definition"></a>
  will have a JSON key representation.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition,
  <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-jsonld-keywords">
  Thing Description instances MAY contain JSON-LD 1.1 keywords such as
  <code>@context</code> and <code>@type</code>.</span>
  </p>

  <!--<p>JSON TD MAY contain vocabulary terms that are not in the 
  Thing Description core model. 
  These vocabulary terms MUST carry a prefix for identification 
  within the key name (e.g., "http:header").</p>-->

  <p>
  The data types of the vocabulary as defined in Section
  <a href="#sec-data-schema-vocabulary-definition"></a>
  will be transformed to JSON-based types. 
  The following rules are used for vocabulary terms based on some simple type 
  definitions:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-string-type">
        Vocabulary terms that use simple types string and anyURI
        MUST be serialized as JSON string.
  </span></li>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-integer-type">
        Vocabulary terms that use simple type unsignedInt
        MUST be serialized as JSON integer.
  </span></li>
  <li><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-number-type">
        Vocabulary terms that use simple type double
        MUST be serialized as JSON number.
  </span></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  All vocabulary terms in Section
  <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definition"></a>
  associated with more complex class-based types are defined separately for 
  structured JSON type transformation in the following subsections.
  </p>

  <section id="sec-thing-as-a-whole-json">
  <h2>Thing as a whole</h2>

  <p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-context">
  The root object of a Thing Description instance MAY include the
  <code>@context</code> key from JSON-LD 1.1 with the value URI of 
  the Thing description context file <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/td</code>.
  </span></p>

<pre class="example">
{  
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/td",
    ...
}
</pre>

  <p class="ednote">
  <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/td</code> uses content negotiation to return the
  context file. Thus, it must be fetched with an <code>Accept</code> header set
  to <code>application/ld+json</code>.
  </p>

  <p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-context-jsonld">
  When a Thing Description instance is processed and interpreted by a
  JSON-LD 1.1 processor the <code>@context</code> field
  MUST be present</span> 
  (see also Section <a href="#note-jsonld-processing" class="sec-ref">JSON-LD 1.1 Processing</a>). 
  </p>

  <p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-additional-contexts">
  When a single Thing Description instance involves several contexts, 
  additional namespaces with prefixes MUST be appended to the 
  <code>@context</code> array structure.</span> 
  This option proves relevant if one wants to extend the existing 
  Thing Description context without modifying it. For instance:
  </p>
<pre class="example">
{
    "@context": ["http://www.w3.org/ns/td",
                {"iot": "http://iotschema.org/"}],

  Each mandatory and optional field name
  as defined in the class <a href="#thing" class="sec-ref"><code>Thing</code></a>
  MUST be serialized as a JSON key 
  in the root object of the Thing Description instance.
  </span></p>

  <!-- should this be "the type" or "the elements of"? -->
  <p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-objects">
  The type of the fields <code>properties</code>, <code>actions</code>, 
  <code>events</code>, and <code>version</code> MUST be a JSON object.

  <p><span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="td-arrays">
  The type of the fields <code>links</code>,
  <code>scopes</code>, and <code>security</code>
  MUST be a JSON array.
  </span></p>

  <p>
  A TD snippet based on the defined fields of the class
  <a href="#thing" class="sec-ref"><code>Thing</code></a>
  without the optional field <code>@context</code> is given below:
  </p>
<pre class="example">

  <p>Alternatively, the same example can be written instead to

    the security configuration in the <code>overheating</code> event

    For the <code>status</code> property and the <code>toggle</code>

      <p>
      Security definitions can also can be given for different elements
      at the same level.  This may be required for devices that support
      multiple protocols, for example CoAP and HTTP, with support for different
      security mechanisms.  This is also useful when alternative authentication
      mechanisms are allowed.  Here is a TD snippet demonstrating three possible
      ways to access a resource: via HTTPS with basic authentication, via HTTPS
      via digest authentication, or via CoAPS with an API key.
      In other words, 
      the use of multiple security configurations at the same level 
      provides a way to combine security mechanisms an in "OR" fashion.
      In contrast, putting multiple security configurations in the same
      <code>security</code> field combines them in an "AND" fashion, 
      since in that case
      they would all need to be satisfied to allow access to the resource.

  Please see the
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-security/">WoT Security and Privacy</a>
  repository for work in progress regarding threat models, assets, risks, 
  recommended mitigations,
  and best practices for security and privacy for systems 
  using the Web of Things.

  <h1>JSON Schema for TD Instance Validation</h1>
  Below is a JSON Schema [[?JSON-SCHEMA-VALIDATION]] for syntactically validating Thing Description instances serialized in JSON-LD 1.1.
  <p class="ednote">
  This schema is known to be too permissive. This issue will be resolved in the next release of this document.

  <h1>Recent Specification Changes</h1>
  <h2 id="changes2">Changes from Second Public Working Draft</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The default serialization format for Thing Description is now 
        plain JSON. 
        Thing Description instances still MAY contain JSON-LD keys such 
        as <code>@context</code> and <code>@type</code> for facilitating semantic evaluation of TDs.
        (see Section <a href="#json-serializiation-section"></a>)</li>
    <li>With regards to JSON-LD, this Thing Description draft uses JSON-LD 1.1 
        instead of JSON-LD 1.0. With this transition, 
        all vocabulary terms defined in vocabulary definition sections 
        now have a JSON key representation.
        Previously, 
        there were vocabulary terms represented as key values in TDs.</li>
    <li>In addition to Thing Description core vocabulary, 
        Thing Description now has the data schema vocabulary reflecting a 
        subset of JSON Schema terms as linked data representation 
        (see Section <a href="#sec-data-schema-vocabulary-definition"></a>) and 
        the security vocabulary 
        (see Section <a href="#sec-security-vocabulary-definition"></a>)
        for defining security based conditions.</li>
    <li>A security field is available at three levels 
        (Thing, Interaction Patterns and Forms) for providing security 
        requirements for accessing resources. 
        Security configuration is mandatory for each <code>form</code>.</li>
    <li>Some vocabulary terms (e.g., <code>readOnly</code>, <code>observable</code>, <code>contentType</code>) 
        now have default values that are used by Thing Description processors 
        when they are absent in TD instances 
        (see Section <a href="#sec-core-vocabulary-definition"></a>).
        Note that some security vocabulary terms can also have such values
        (see Section <a href="#sec-security-vocabulary-definition"></a>).</li>
    <li>Things now have a mandatory field <code>id</code> for uniquely identifying a Thing, 
        and an optional field <code>support</code> to provide information about 
        Thing Description maintainer.</li>
    <li>Interaction patterns have an optional <code>label</code> field providing text 
        for such uses as user interfaces.</li>
    <li>The <code>rel</code> attribute for <code>form</code> now has 
        enumerated allowable values specified.</li>
    <li>JSON-LD @context key value to represent the Thing description context file 
        now is <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/td</code>.</li>
    <li>Added a section about media types used for exchanging TDs.
        (see Section <a href="#media-type-section"></a>)</li>
    <li>Added a section about implementation notes that provide useful 
        clarifications to implementors.
        (see Section <a href="#Implementation-Note-section"></a>)</li>
    <li>A JSON Schema is provided in an appendix section to facilitate 
        the validation of Thing Description instances. 
        (see Section <a href="#json-schema-4-validation"></a>)</li>
</li>
  </ul>
