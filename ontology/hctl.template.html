            This document introduces an ontology for links and forms, the main hypermedia
            controls in use on the Web. This ontology offers, among others, a means to reify
            RDF statements interpreted as links between Web resources. It also provides
            a versatile exchange format for links and forms in RESTful Web applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hypermedia controls are of importance in the fields of the Web of Things and
            the Embedded Web, in particular in the W3C Thing Description model and the IETF
            Constrained RESTful Application Language.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            The concept of Representational State Transfer (REST) [[rest]] is at the core of most modern
            Web applications. The state of a Web resources, exposed via a collection of Web
            resources, can be browsed by clients by following <em>links</em> and acted upon by submitting
            <em>forms</em> to servers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Links and forms have always be present in Web technologies, including HTML [[html]]. Web
            linking [[rfc8288]] is a fundamental principle of the Web architecture that can be leveraged to
            drive applications, e.g. when a server returns a link to a newly created resource as the
            result of a client's request. Conversely, forms, are request templates that servers can expose
            to clients for them to fill in with client-specific information and send back to servers.
            Forms are similar in spirit to operation desriptions as defined by the Open API Specification
            [[openapis]] or by the Hydra RDF vocabulary [[hydra]].
        </p>

        <p>
            Links and forms are generically referred to as <em>hypermedia controls</em>. They are
            of increasing importance in the fields of the Web of Things and the Embedded Web,
            which respectively led to the standardization of the Thing Description (TD) model
            [[wot-thing-description]] and the Constrained RESTful Application Language (CoRAL)
            [[coral]]. The present hypermedia controls ontology is an attempt to formalize the
            concepts these two standards specify.

        <h2>Alignments</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>Hydra</h3>

            <p>
                The following table gives alignment between the hypermedia controls
                ontology and <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#">Hydra</a>,
                an alternative vocabulary for hypermedia-driven Web APIs. Each row
                represents a close match between two classes. These alignments are
                not to be understood as formal semantic equivalences but rather as
                hints to Hydra users.
            </p>

            <table class="def">
                <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td><code>hctl:Link</code></td>
                            <td><code>hydra:Link</code></td>
                        </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>hctl:Form</code></td>
                        <td><code>hydra:Operation</code></td>
