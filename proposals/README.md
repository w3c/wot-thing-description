# Proposals to the WoT TD Specification

This folder contains proposals that do not fit a single issue or pull request when the discussions take place.
Based on the content of these proposals, big features can be evaluated in a defined folder and not mix with the editor's drafts.

The status of a proposal is indicated next to it with the following meanings:

- In Progress: The proposal is being actively discussed
- Rejected: The proposal is not accepted by the TF
- Paused: The proposal is not rejected but there is no active work happening on it
- Accepted: The proposal is in use by the TF
- Retired: The proposal was accepted and used but it is not relevant anymore and thus is retired.
