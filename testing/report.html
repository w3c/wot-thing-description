   entered the Candidate Recommendation period on XX February 2019.</p>

<p> The planned date for entering Proposed Recommendation is XX March 2019.
This document
summarizes the results from the Web of Things (WoT) TD implementation reports received and
describes the process that the Web of Things (WoT) Working Group followed in preparing the report.</p>

<h4 id="h_objectives"><a id="objectives" name="objectives">1.1 Implementation report objectives</a></h4>

4. Entrance criteria for the Proposed Recommendation phase</a></h2>
<p>The Web of Things (WoT) Working Group established the following
entrance criteria for the Proposed Recommendation phase in the
Request for CR:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sufficient reports of implementation experience have been
gathered to demonstrate that Things can be described by Thing Descriptions 
in sufficient detail to allow interoperabilty.</li>
<li>Specific Implementation Report Requirements (<a href="testing/report.html#report_reqs">outlined below</a>) have been met.</li>
<li>The Working Group has formally addressed and responded to all 
    public comments received by the Working Group.</li>
</ol>
<p>All three of these criteria have been met. 
<!-- Hard to count since some implementations have multiple components, and some are shared.  Omit.
A total of N implementations were documented by M different organizations.
-->
The testimonials below indicate the broad base of support 
for the specification. All of the required features had at least
two implementations. 
All of the optional features received at least two implementations.
However, these optional features do not have 
conformance requirements that have an impact on interoperability. </p>

<h4 id="h_DetailedReqs">
<a id="DetailedReqs" shape="rect" name="DetailedReqs">5.1 Detailed requirements for implementation report</a></h4>
<ol>
	<li>Testimonials from implementers are included in the IR when
provided to document the utility and implementability of the
specification.</li>
	<li>IR must cover all specified features in the specification. For
each feature the IR should indicate:
    <ul>
	     <li>Feature status: required, optional, other.</li>
	     <li>Feature utility/usefulness based on feedback from
implementers.</li>
	     <li>Implementability of the feature specification.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Feature status is a factor in test coverage in the report:
    <ul>
		<li>Required specification features must have at least two
implementations. Implementations that do not implement a required
specification feature must document the reason for not implementing
the feature.</li>
		<li>Optional specification features must have at least one
implementation. Implementations that do not implement an optional specification
feature should document the reason for not implementing the
feature. </li>

<a id="systems" name="systems">6. Systems</a></h2>
<p>This section contains descriptions of each of the implementations
of the WoT Thing Description specification
from all organizations that submitted implementation reports.
Each implementation represents a working system 
that either exposes or consumes at least one WoT Thing Description.
Implementations that expose a Thing Description act as a network
server with an interface as described in the Thing Description it exposes. 
Implementations that consume a Thing Description act as a network
client and issue network requests consistent with the target Thing Description.
In some cases a given implementation may be used for multiple Things
and a single Thing may also act as both client and server on
multiple interfaces.
</p><p>
We only count systems with mostly independent code bases 
as distinct implementations.
There are however some cases (documented in the following) where 
implementations shared components but were still considered substantially
independent implementations.  In cases where a substantial component
was shared across implementations the features supported by that 
component were only counted once.

<h3>W3C/ERCIM</h3>   
<p><a href="https://github.com/draggett/arena-webhub">Arena Web Hub</a> 
is an open source node-based application server for the Web of Things 
that has been implemented with support from the European Commission for the 
<a href="https://www.f-interop.eu">F-Interop project</a> 
as a means to demonstrate high level interoperability testing for the Web of Things.</p>
<p>One of the example applications is a browser-based test suite for both client and server 
in respect to the contract implied by a Thing Description. 
This uses a specially designed Thing Description, 
together with associated client and server applications,
and has been developed to cover the constraints implied by 
the data schemas defined by the Thing Description specification.</p>
<h4 id="impl-ercim-arena-client">Arena Client: TD Consumer</h4>
<p>This is a browser-based JavaScript library designed to support multiple server platforms, 
including the Arena Web Hub, Eclipse ThingWeb (node-wot), and Mozilla&apos;s Things Gateway.</p>
<h4 id="impl-ercim-arena-webhub">Arena WebHub: TD Producer</h4>
<p>Arena Web Hub is a secure by design application server with support for HTTPS and WebSockets. 
HTTPS is used together with a bearer token for access control, 
along with support for Server-Sent Events and Long Polling. 
You can get or set the values of all properties in a single transaction. 
The WebSockets sub-protocol is initiated via a protocol upgrade request from HTTPS, 
and includes suppport for properties, actions and events. 
This makes use of a RESTful request/response pattern with the same status codes as for HTTPS. 
Arena has minimal dependencies on other modules and can be installed 
via npm or a git clone of the open source repository. 
Applications can combine the producer and consumer modules as needed.</p>
</div><div class="impl" id="impl-hitachi">   
<h3>Hitachi, Ltd.</h3>   
<p>Hitachi understands the importance of standardization
    to make the world seamlessly connected, and strongly supports W3C&apos;s activities.</p>
<p>Hitachi expects that standardization of Web of Things enables easy integration
    accross various Things and IoT platforms.  We create a tool for
    rapid application development using <a href="https://nodered.org/">Node-RED</a>,
    called <a href="https://github.com/k-toumura/node-red-nodegen/tree/webofthings">Node generator</a>.</p>
<h4 id="impl-hitachi-nodegen">Node generator for Node-RED: TD consumer</h4>
<p>Node generator is command line tool to generate Node-RED node modules from several
 various sources including Thing Description of Web of Things. 
 Using this tool, node developers can dramatically reduce their time 
 to implement Node-RED node modules.
</p>
</div><div class="impl" id="impl-intel">
<h3>Intel Corporation</h3>   
<p>Intel supports this specification as it enables interoperation between devices
from different manufacturers, supporting the growth of an ecosystem of interoperating
IoT services and easing barriers to adoption.
</p>
<p>Three separate implementations were developed, all based on Node.js.
The core implementations focused on basic local network access without built-in security.
A separate project, used by all three implementations, provided security (encryption and
authentication) by means of a reverse proxy. 
For the purposes of validation this reverse proxy was considered a shared component of all three implementations, 
and the features it implemented were only counted once in the results.
</p>
<h4 id="impl-intel-security">Security Proxy: Shared Component</h4>
This component, shared across all implementations provided by Intel, was a reverse proxy service that provided
authentication (via various mechanisms indicated by the schemes indicated in the Thing
Description) and encrypted transport termination.
The reverse proxy service was made accessible over a secure tunnel, and depending on the circumstances,
was run in the cloud, on a gateway computer, or locally on a device.
As this component implemented the security features in all other implementations
from Intel, for the purposes of validation
these features are only recorded as being supported in a single implementation.
<p></p>
<h4 id="impl-intel-ocf">OCF Metadata Translator: TD Producer</h4>
<p>This implementation translated metadata made available by devices implemented using
the OCF standard and re-expressed that metadata in the form of WoT Thing Descriptions.
The actual network interfaces were however provided either by the OCF devices themselves
directly via CoAP, or via a CoAP/HTTP bridge developed by OCF. 
The metadata
translator also had the ability to add semantic markup to the generated WoT Thing Descriptions,
using a database that related OCF Resource Types to iotschema.org capabilities.
It also had the capability to register generated TDs with directory services.
Secure interfaces (e.g. HTTPS combined with an authentication scheme) were provided
via a reverse proxy attached to the HTTP interface provided by the OCF CoAP/HTTP bridge.
</p>
<p>The OCF devices were based on the OCF Smart Home Demo and included both
real and simulated devices. Real devices used for testing included
</p><ol>
<li>ON\OFF Lights (various: MOSFET, Relay, LEDs),</li>
<li>RGB Light,</li>
<li>Potentiometer (analog input),</li>
<li>Toggle Switch,</li>
<li>Pushbutton,</li>
<li>IR Motion Sensor,</li>
<li>Illuminance Sensor, and</li>
<li>Buzzer.</li>
</ol>
There were also multiple instances of many of these devices, each given 
unique identifiers.
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4 id="impl-intel-speak">WebSpeak: TD Producer</h4>
<p>This implementation provided a service to convert text to speech.  English
text set to its network interface was spoken audibily.  This service was used to
test several accessibility scenarios, including automatic conversion of visible status
and event information to spoken announcements in order to support blind users.
This implementation only supported an HTTP network interface, without security.
Secure interfaces (eg HTTPS combined with an authentication scheme) were provided
via a reverse proxy attached to the HTTP interface.
The TDs for this service were generated using a template mechanism,
and the service also had the capability to automatically register these
TDs with a directory service.
</p>
<h4 id="impl-intel-camera">Simple Web Camera: TD Producer</h4>
<p>This implementation provided a service to capture still images from a camera
and provide them over its network interface.  This was used to test various aspects
of actions, including support for inputs and outputs with different content types.
The service was also capaple of introspecting the parameters made available via any
particular attached video4linux camera
and made those parameters available as WoT Thing Description properties.
This implementation only supported an HTTP network interface, without security.
Secure interfaces (eg HTTPS combined with an authentication scheme) were provided
via a reverse proxy attached to the HTTP interface.
The TDs for this service were generated using a template mechanism,
and the service also had the capability to automatically register these
TDs with a directory service.
</p>
</div><div class="impl" id="impl-oracle"> 
<h3>Oracle Corporation</h3>
<p>
Oracle supports this specification as it enables manufacturers of IoT cloud platforms and applications
to integrate devices across multiple vendors, who describe their features and functionality in a uniform way. 
This enables application scenarios that allow monitoring and control of devices from different manufacturers.
Flexible rules can be used to define alert conditions that trigger actions on devices based on sensor data from other devices.
Sensor data combined with big data analytics can be used to predict maintenance needs of devices
to prevent downtime.
</p>
<p>
A common way of describing devices grows the ecosystem of devices that can be easily integrated into 
cloud platforms out of the box and thus enables creating digital twins of physical devices
for asset monitoring, production monitoring, fleet management, and the management of buildings and smart cities.
</p>
<p>
Oracle offers an IoT cloud platform that enables management of devices, messages and alerts.
This platform is complemented with applications for asset monitoring, production monitoring, fleet management
and connected workers.
This platform interoperates with WoT servients as described in the sections below.
</p>

<h4 id="impl-oracle-converters">Thing Description to Device Model Converters: TD Consumer and Producer</h4>
<p>Oracle&apos;s IoT cloud platform defines a device model abstraction that is used to describe the common
behaviour of a class of devices via properties (attributes), actions, messages and alerts.
This format is similar to the WoT thing description and thing descriptions can be converted
to device models and vice versa.<br>
Devices that are managed by the IoT cloud platform can be expose using the WoT thing description format
and devices that are described via thing descriptions can be consumed from the IoT cloud service. 
Oracle provides open source implementations of converters to generate a device model from a thing description (td2dm)
and vice versa (dm2td).
</p>

<h4 id="impl-oracle-simulators">Oracle Digital Twin Simulator: TD Producer</h4>
<p> 
Oracle&apos;s IoT Cloud Service includes a simulator for devices which allows to model 
and test asset monitoring scenarios without having the physical device already available.
This allows experimenting with different device models and finding the right abstraction
before a device is actually manufacturered and thus reduce the implementation risk.
Various device simulations were defined:

</p><ul>
<li>HVAC</li>  
<li>BluePump</li>
<li>Truck</li>
<li>Connected Car</li>  
</ul>

These simulations were exposed via TDs that were generated from device models using 
the converters above.
The simulator uses HTTP/REST with JSON to interact with the devices. 

TD&apos;s for devices from other manufacterer were imported using the td2dm converter and
simulators were defined for the following devices:

<ul>
<li>Fujitsu&apos;s rotary beacon light</li>
<li>Intel&apos;s RGB light</li>
<li>Panasonic&apos;s air conditioner</li>
<li>Panasonic&apos;s hue light</li>
<li>Siemens Festo Plant</li>
<li>KETI environment sensor</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h4 id="impl-oracle-node-wot">Node-WoT with Oracle Binding: TD Consumer</h4>
<p> 
Node-Wot contains a binding to Oracle&apos;s IoT Cloud Service.
The binding uses Oracle&apos;s JavaScript client library that encapsulates 
Oracle&apos;s proprietary device to cloud communication protocol.
The integration allows node-wot to consume TDs for devices from other manufacturers and to read properties
and trigger actions on these devices.
</p>

<h4 id="impl-oracle-asset-monitoring">Oracle Asset Monitoring: Interoperability across Manufacturers</h4>
<p>
Oracle&apos;s Asset Monitoring application is used to define scenarios that combine devices from 
different manufacturers. Flexible rules trigger actions and issue alerts based on sensor data from 
other devices.<br>
In an industrial scenario that integrates devices from KETI, Fujitsu, Siemens and Intel was defined
and several rules control RGB lights, speech output, a valve and a pump based on sensor 
data from different devices.
</p>

</div><div class="impl" id="impl-panasonic"> 
<h3>Panasonic Corporation</h3>
<p>
Panasonic supports this specification as it enables device manufacturers 
to describe features and functionality of multiple devices in a uniform way. 
This will make it possible to build mash-up applications easily with multiple devices 
not only from single vendor but also from different vendors, which will expand the ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
Panasonic already has various IoT devices in the market and this specification is the 
first candidate to be used for the directory system to discover those devices.
At the moment, 
Panasonic implements two types of clients (TD consumer) as well as two types of servers (TD producer), 
together with independent authentication server as a shared component, for experimental purposes.
</p>

<h4 id="impl-panasonic-authentication">Authentication Server: Shared Component</h4>
<p>This component provides authentication functionality for users who access Panasonic things (TD producers) 
such as the real things or simulated things provided by other implementations. 
This component supports HTTPS, 
receives a predetermined userid and password via an HTTP POST method and sends back a bearer token based on JWT.
The token should be placed in the Authentication request header upon access to a Thing supporting
the `&quot;bearer&quot;` security scheme. 
The URL and other information of this component is provided in the security 
elements of the Thing Descriptions produced by Panasonic things. </p>

<h4 id="impl-panasonic-client-browser">Browser Based Client: TD Consumer</h4>
<p>This implementation is a TD Consumer which works on the Chrome browser. 
This implementation reads a Thing Description from a designated URL via HTTP(S), 
expands its properties, actions and events into UI form, 
then allows user to read, write or observe a property value, 
invoke an action, 
or subscribe/unsubscribe to an event through the UI. 
When the TD indicates that the thing needs a bearer token, 
this implementation also supports the settting of user credentials such as userid and password 
and retrieves the access token from the authentication service at the URL designated in the TD, 
such as the Panasonic Authentication Server explained above. 
This implementation also allows the manual addition of any HTTP headers 
to the request message sent to the things.
</p>
<p>This implementation basically supports only HTTP(S) and does not support CoAP and MQTT. 
For observe property and events, 
this implementation supports both HTTP(S) long poll and a simple WebSocket protocol 
which contains only a data value in its transaction. 
This implementation only supports application/json as message body and does not support text/plain. 
Since this implementation is browser based and uses Ajax, 
its default mode requires support of CORS from the server exposing the Things, 
unless the chrome browser is launched with the <code>--disable-web-security</code> option.
</p>

<h4 id="impl-panasonic-client-nodered">Node-RED Based Client: TD Consumer</h4>
<p>This implementation is a TD Consumer which works on Node-RED. 
This implementation reads a Thing Description from a designated URL via HTTP(S) and from a local folder, 
finds a specific thing according to a semantic annotation, and turns the thing on/off. 
The implementation supports only HTTP(S) with `&quot;nosec&quot;` and `&quot;basic&quot;` authorization. 
For MQTT and WebSockets, 
this implementation needs a hard-coded URL due to the restriction of normal Node-RED.
</p>

<h4 id="impl-panasonic-server-real">WoT Server for Real Devices: TD Producer</h4>
<p>This implementation is a TD producer which is hosted on a cloud server and 
connected to real things in the lab through a proprietary tunneling mechanism alike to remote and local WoT proxy. 
This implementation accepts HTTP bindings with bearer token authorization issued by the 
Panasonic Authentication Server explained above. 
This implementation currently provides the following things: 
</p><ol>
<li>Two Home Air Conditioners,</li> 
<li>One robotics cleaner,</li> 
<li>One set of Philips Hue Lighting and</li> 
<li>Two LED bulletin boards.</li> 
</ol>
This implementation is based on Apache HTTP server with plugins written in PHP. <p></p>

<h4 id="impl-panasonic-server-simulator">WoT Simulator: TD Producer</h4>
<p>This implementation is a TD producer which is hosted on a cloud server and 
hosts virtual things running on the server. 
This implementation accepts HTTP bindings with bearer token authorization issued by the 
Panasonic Authentication Server explained above. 
This implementation currently provides simulation of things such as 
</p><ol>
<li>Home Air Conditioner,</li> 
<li>Robotics cleaner,</li> 
<li>Philips Hue Lighting and</li> 
<li>Simple LED lighting.</li> 
</ol>
This implementation is based on Node.js. 
This implementation is portable and also can be run on a local machine such as a Raspberry Pi.

<h3>Siemens AG</h3>   
<p>
Siemens supports this specification as it allows manufacturers
to attach metadata to heterogeneous IoT devices and services in a uniform way.
The extensible model with a standardized serialization format in particular remedies interoperability challenges 
with an installed base of long-lived industrial devices.
Furthermore, 
this specification is a central building block for several digitalization topics such as 
device onboarding, 
device management, 
digital twins, 
and 
data analytics.
</p>
<p>
Siemens commits to several open-source implementations of W3C Web of Things, 
which are managed in the public Eclipse Thingweb project.
Siemens also implemented concepts of this specification in products and 
aims at aligning the implementations and opening the features to customers 
once this specification reaches REC status.
</p>
<h4 id="impl-siemens-node-wot">node-wot: TD Consumer and Producer</h4>
<p>
The node-wot implementation is a Node.js-based framework for WoT Servients.
It features an implementation of the WoT Scripting API to both consume TDs to instantiate Consumed Things 
and produce Exposed Things that provide a TD.
The node-wot implementation supports several Protocol Bindings including 
HTTP, CoAP, WebSockets, and MQTT,
with corresponding security mechanisms such as 
DTLS (CoAP); 
TLS (HTTP, MQTT),
Basic, Digest, and Bearer Token authentication (HTTP), 
PSK (CoAP), and 
username/password authentication (MQTT). 
</p>
<h4 id="impl-siemens-thingweb-directory">Thingweb Directory: TD Consumer and Producer</h4>
<p>
The Thingweb Directory provides a directory service written in Java to register TDs 
and look them up through queries (primarily SPARQL).
The implementation consumes TDs registered with it through a web API,
represent their metadata in a KnowledgeGraph, and (re-)produces TDs to return the results of queries.
Currently it supports HTTP and CoAP bindings.
</p>
<h4 id="impl-siemens-wot-fxui">WoT-fxUI: TD Consumer</h4>
<p>
WoT-fxUI is a generic user interface (UI) for Things based on Java with JavaFX.
It consumes TDs to render UI elements that allow human users to interact with Things.
The implementation currently supports HTTP and CoAP bindings.

<h2 id="h_security"><a id="security-xml" name="security-xml"></a>
<a id="security" name="security">7. Security</a></h2>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description Specification</a> 
includes features to support security.
Functional aspects of assertions associated with security features are validated 
in the same fashion as other functional features.

In addition, however, the 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/12/wot-wg-2016.html">Web of Things (WoT) WG Charter</a> 
requires the development of a test plan that includes adversarial testing.
An appropriate security test plan, including a description
of how existing web service penetration testing tools can be used,
is given in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-security-testing">Web of Things (WoT) Security Testing Plan</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Security validation is in addition to a description of more general security and privacy
considerations given in  
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-security/">Web of Things (WoT) Security and Privacy Considerations</a> 
and the security and privacy considerations given in the specification
itself.
</p>
<p>
Note the WoT TD specification 
is designed to support the description of existing devices 
which may not be secure by current standards, 
such adversarial testing will normally be limited to 
security configurations following the
best-practices security configurations given 
in 
<!-- BEST-PRACTICES -->
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-security-best-practices">Web of Things (WoT) Security Best Practices</a>. 
for which security is an expectation.

<h3 id="test_assertions_h"><a id="test_assertions" name="test_assertions">8.1 Test assertion results</a></h3>
<p>The aim of this section is to describe the range of test assertions
developed for the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xxx">Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description Specification</a> 
and summarize the results from the implementation 
reports received in the CR period.
The table lists all assertions derived from the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xxx">Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description Specification</a>.
</p> 
<ul>
<li>The <b>ID</b> column uniquely identifies the assertion.
and links to the assertion in the context of the specification.
</li>
<li>The <b>Assertion</b> column specifies the constraint which must be met.
</li>
<li>The <b>Req</b> column is a Y/N value indicating whether the test assertion is for a feature which is required.
Note however that the feature may only be required if another feature is also used, as indicated in
the <b>Context</b> column.
</li>
<li>The <b>Parent</b> column indicates another more general assertion that this one is a specialization of.
A specialization indicates a more restrictive context or provides additional detail to facilitate testing.
The more general assertion is only considered to have a &quot;pass&quot; status if all its required
or implmented specializations in a given implementation have a &quot;pass&quot; status.
</li>
<li>The <b>Context</b> column indicates that the &quot;required&quot; status of this feature depends on the use
of other features.
If the context is optional,
then the value of <b>Req</b> actually indicates whether the feature is required 
if the indicated context exists.
</li>
<li>The <b>Result</b> column is annotated with the number of &apos;pass&apos; (<b>P</b>), &apos;fail&apos; (<b>F</b>), and &apos;not implemented&apos; (<b>N</b>)
status results in the individual implementation reports.
</li>
<li>The <b>T</b> column indicates the total number of implementations (or implementation components in the case
of shared components) reporting a status (of any kind) on each assertion.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="test_interop_h"><a id="test_interop" name="test_interop">8.2 Interoperability results</a></h3>
<p>This section documents specific pairs of implementations for which
interoperability has been demonstrated. 
Each row represents a producer and each column a consumer.
If a pairing has at least one recorded instance of interoperation,
and no recorded failures, then it is marked as a &quot;Pass&quot;.
If a pairing also has at least one recorded instance that uses a 
security configuration identified in
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-security/">WoT Security Best Practices</a> 
then it is marked as &quot;Secure&quot;.
However, if such a pairing has <em>any</em> reported failures, no matter how many
other successful pairings it has, including secure pairings,
it is marked as a &quot;Fail&quot;.
Note that since implementations refer to code bases that may
be used for many services or devices, 
each successful pairing reported may in practice correspond 
to a number of successful service or device pairings.

Assertion seems ambiguous.
Other assertions constrain the location and
