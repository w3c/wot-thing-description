<p><a href="https://github.com/draggett/arena-webhub ">Arena Web Hub</a> is an open source node-based application server for the Web of Things that has been implemented with support from the European Commission for the <a href="https://www.f-interop.eu">F-Interop project</a> as a means to demonstrate high level interoperability testing for the Web of Things.</p>
<p>One of the example applications is a browser-based test suite for both client and server in respect to the contract implied by a thing description. This uses a specially design thing description, together with associated client and server applictions and has been developed to cover the constraints implied by the data schemas defined by the Thing Description specification.</p>
<h4 id="impl-ercim-arena-client">Implementation 1: TD Consumer</h4>
<p>This is a browser-based JavaScript library designed to support multiple server platforms, including the Arena Web Hub, Eclipse ThingWeb (node-wot) and Mozilla's Things Gateway.</p>
<h4 id="impl-ercim-arena-webhub">Implementation 2: TD Producer</h4>
<p>Arena Web Hub is a secure by design application server with support for HTTPS and WebSockets. HTTPS is used together with a bearer token for access control, along with support for Server-Sent Events and Long Polling. You can get or set the value sof all properties in a single transaction. The WebSockets sub-protocol is initiated via a protocol upgrade request from HTTPS, and includes suppport for properties, actions and events. This makes use of a RESTful request/response pattern with the same status codes as for HTTPS. Arena has minimal dependencies on other modules and can be installed via npm or a git clone of the open source repository.</p>
