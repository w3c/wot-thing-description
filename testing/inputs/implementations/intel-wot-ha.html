  <h4>intel-wot-ha: TD Directory and TD Exposer</h4>
  <p>
  A simple integration of WoT into Home Assistant.
  A service interrogates the metadata made available from Home Assistant on
  its external RESTful API. It then generates TDs for Home Assistant entities
  that can be accessed via this API and makes then available via
  a TD Directory service that follows the WoT Discovery specification.
  WoT Consumers can then access the TD Directory to find TDs for
  entities supported by Home Assistant and access these services
  using WoT affordance abstractions.
