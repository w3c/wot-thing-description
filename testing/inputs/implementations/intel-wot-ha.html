  <h4>intel-wot-ha: TD Directory and TD Exposer</h4>
  <p>
    A simple integration of WoT into Home Assistant. A service interrogates the metadata made available from Home
    Assistant on its external RESTful API. It then generates TDs for Home Assistant entities that can be accessed via
    this API and makes then available via a TD Directory service that follows the WoT Discovery specification. WoT
    Consumers can then access the TD Directory to find TDs for entities supported by Home Assistant and access these
    services using WoT affordance abstractions.
