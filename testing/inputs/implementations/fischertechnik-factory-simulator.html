    This TM focused implementation is built upon the <a href="https://www.fischertechnik.de/en/service/elearning/simulating/fabrik-simulation-24v">Fischertechnik Factory Simulator</a>.
    The TMs are written by hand, together with the relationships.
    The TMs are then consumed by Eclipse Thingweb node-wot and is the reason why only TMs are submitted instead of TMs and
    the corresponding TDs.

    <b>Usage:</b> To be consumed by tools like Eclipse Thingweb node-wot
