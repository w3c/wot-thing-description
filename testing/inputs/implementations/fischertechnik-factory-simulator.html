    This TM focused implementation is built upon the
    <a href="https://www.fischertechnik.de/en/service/elearning/simulating/fabrik-simulation-24v"
      >Fischertechnik Factory Simulator</a
    >. The TMs are written by hand, together with the relationships. The TMs are then consumed by Eclipse Thingweb
    node-wot and is the reason why only TMs are submitted instead of TMs and the corresponding TDs.

  <p><b>Usage:</b> To be consumed by tools like Eclipse Thingweb node-wot</p>
