  <p>
    The library <code>dart_wot</code> is a WoT Scripting API implementation written in the Dart programming language,
    aimed at bringing Web of Things support to the Dart/Flutter ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
    It supports consuming and discovering TDs, providing protocol bindings for HTTP, CoAP, and MQTT. Its supported
    security mechanisms include DTLS (CoAP), TLS (HTTP, MQTT), Basic and Bearer authentication (HTTP), PSK (CoAP), and
    username/password authentication (MQTT). Furthermore,
    <code>dart_wot</code>'s CoAP binding offers experimental support for ACE-OAuth (RFC 9200), an authorization and
    authentication framework for constrained environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Usage:</strong> <code>dart_wot</code> can be included in Dart and Flutter projects as a dependency. In
    Flutter apps, all platforms are supported, with macOS and iOS (where CoAPS support is limited) and Web browsers
    (where CoAP is not supported at all) as partial exceptions.
