  <h4 id="impl-tinyiot">TinyIoT Thing Directory</h4>
  <p>
    This is an implementation of the W3C Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description Directory (TDD). This directory is
    designed to be lightweight and portable, enabling deployment on the edge. It uses a layered architecture to allows
    the addition of different storage backends to server high scalability needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The directory advertises itself in local networks using DNS-SD. It comes with the Things and Notification APIs, as
    well as JSONPath search support (non-normative). The directory performs fine-grained access control with the help of
    locally defined rules and an OpenID Connect server.
