  <p>
    This implementation leverages the already developed Philips Hue devices. The TDs for them are written by hand and
    show the use of WoT for brownfield devices. Philips Hue uses API Key in the URI, which is one of the features of the
    TD 1.1.
  </p>
  <p><b>Usage:</b> The TDs of the devices can be consumed and interacted with.</p>
