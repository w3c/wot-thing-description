  <p>
    This implementation leverages the already developed Philips Hue devices. The TDs for them are written by hand and show the use of WoT for brownfield
    devices. Philips Hue uses API Key in the URI, which is one of the features of the TD 1.1.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Usage:</b> The TDs of the devices can be consumed and interacted with.
