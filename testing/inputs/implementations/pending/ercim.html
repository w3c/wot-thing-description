<a href="https://github.com/draggett/arena-webhub">Arena Web Hub</a> 
is an open source node-based application server for the Web of Things 
that has been implemented with support from the European Commission for the 
<a href="https://www.f-interop.eu">F-Interop project</a> 
as a means to demonstrate high level interoperability testing for the Web of Things.
</p>
<p>
One of the example applications is a browser-based test suite for both client and server 
in respect to the contract implied by a Thing Description. 
This uses a specially designed Thing Description, 
together with associated client and server applications,
and has been developed to cover the constraints implied by 
the data schemas defined by the Thing Description specification.
</p>
<p>
Other example applications include remote control of a cyber-physical system,
a digital twin for a smart light, and multi-channel data streaming for remote
diagnosis of cardiac problems. All of these applications combine an exposed thing
with a web page for the associated user interface.

including the Arena Web Hub, Eclipse ThingWeb (node-wot), and Mozilla's Things Gateway.

<p>
Arena Web Hub is a secure by design application server with support for HTTPS and WebSockets. 
HTTPS is used together with a bearer token for access control, 
along with support for Server-Sent Events and Long Polling. 
You can get or set the values of all properties in a single transaction. 
The WebSockets sub-protocol is initiated via a protocol upgrade request from HTTPS, 
and includes suppport for properties, actions and events. 
This makes use of a RESTful request/response pattern with the same status codes as for HTTPS. 
Arena has minimal dependencies on other modules and can be installed 
via npm or a git clone of the open source repository. 
Applications can combine the producer and consumer modules as needed.
