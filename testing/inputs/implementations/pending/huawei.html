  Huawei supports this specification as a practical solution to counter fragmentation in the IoT.
  W3C Web of Things aligns, for instance, with oneM2M, where WoT Thing Descriptions are considered as a solution for the so-called Interworking Proxies.
  A particularly noteworthy benefit of W3C Web of Things is that it applies to any IoT application domain, from consumer electronics to heavy industries.
</p>
<p>
  At this stage, Huawei focuses on supporting the standardization process.
  The implementations cover features of the comprehensive and versatile specification that are not sufficiently covered by others.

<h4 id="impl-huawei-californium">WoT-enabled Californium (Cf) CoAP framework: TD Producer</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/californium/">Eclipse Californium</a> is a comprehensive implementation of the Constrained Application Protocol (RFC&nbsp;7252).
  It supports all DTLS security schemes, PSK, certificates, and RawPublicKey.
  By providing WoT Thing Descriptions (TDs), CoAP servers implemented by Californium &ndash; or any other CoAP implementation &ndash; become part of the Web of Things.
  Huawei provides TDs for the Californium demo apps, in particular <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/californium/tree/2.0.x/demo-apps/cf-secure">cf-secure</a> to demonstrate the feasibility to describe CoAPS security schemes.
</p>

<h4 id="impl-huawei-php">Meta-Interaction Thing: TD Producer</h4>
<p>
  This implementation supports the full range of meta-interactions possible for Things.
  They are declared and described through the <code>forms</code> array within the TD root object and allow to
  read/write all Properties or to read/write multiple Properties.
</p>
<p>
  The Meta-Interaction Thing also supports language negotiation and secures one Property with Digest and another with a fictional
  Useless Web Token (UWT) that is described through a TD Context Extension (security scheme <code>bearer</code> with <code>format</code> set to the UWT class name).
