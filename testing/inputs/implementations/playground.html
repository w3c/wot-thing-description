  <h4 id="impl-playground">Thing Description Playground: Tool</h4>
  <p>
    The Thing Description Playground implementation is a set of tools that allows one to validate TDs, as well to
    transform them into different representations such as OpenAPI and AsyncAPI or to manipulate TDs to add or remove
    default terms and values. It also allows to detect implemented assertions of the TD spec by looking at a TD, which
    is how the implementation report for the TD is generated.

  <p>
    <b>Usage:</b> It can be included in bigger projects as a dependency, used as a Command Line Interface or as a web
    application library.
