  <h4 id="impl-playground">Thing Description Playground: Tool</h4>
  <p>
    The Thing Description Playground implementation is a set of tools that
    allows one to validate TDs, as well to transform them into different
    representations such as OpenAPI and AsyncAPI or to manipulate TDs to add or remove default terms and values. 
    It also allows to detect implemented assertions of the TD spec by looking at a TD, which is how the
    implementation report for the TD is generated.

  <p>
    <b>Usage:</b> It can be included in bigger projects as a dependency, used as
    a Command Line Interface or as a web application library.
