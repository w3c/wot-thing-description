  <h4>fujitsu-proxy: Intermediary</h4>
  <p>
    Fujitsu's proxy creates a shadow of the device in the proxy, allowing consumers to control the actual device by
    accessing the shadow. Even if the actual device does not have an authentication mechanism, the proxy provides an
    authentication mechanism instead to enable secure access. Another advantage is that even if multiple devices have
    different protocol bindings, they can be accessed using one protocol. It also has a directory for discovering
    networked devices, creating their shadows, and registering them.
  </p>
  <p>The proxy is implemented in Java.</p>

    This proxy is provided as a product in Japan. The product page is below (Japanese only).
