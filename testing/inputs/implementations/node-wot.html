  <p>
    The Eclipse node-wot implementation is a Node.js-based framework for WoT Servients.
    It features an implementation of the WoT Scripting API to both consume TDs
    to instantiate Consumed Things and produce Exposed Things that provide a TD.
    The Eclipse node-wot implementation supports several Protocol Bindings including
    HTTP, CoAP, WebSockets, MQTT, Firestore, OPC-UA, Modbus, M-Bus and NETCONF with 
    corresponding security mechanisms such as DTLS (CoAP); TLS (HTTP, MQTT), Basic, 
    Digest, and Bearer Token authentication (HTTP), PSK (CoAP), and 
    username/password authentication (MQTT).
