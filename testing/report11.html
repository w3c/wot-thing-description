<!--
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description</a>
  specification entered the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-thing-description-20190516/">Candidate Recommendation</a> 
  period for the second time on 6 November 2019.
  The planned date for entering Proposed Recommendation is 10 December 2019.
</p>
-->
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/">Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description 1.1</a>
  document was last published as a
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/WD-wot-thing-description11-20220803/">Working Draft</a>
  on 3 August 2022.
  The planned date for entering Candidate Recommendation is 22 September 2022.
  The planned date for entering Proposed Recommendation is 24 November 2022.
</p>
<p>
  This document summarizes the results from the Web of Things (WoT) TD implementer reports received and
  describes the process that the Web of Things (WoT) Working Group followed in preparing this <em>Implementation Report (IR)</em>.
</p>

<h4 id="h_objectives"><a id="objectives" name="objectives">1.1 Implementation Report objectives</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Must verify that the specification is implementable.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="h_non_objectives"><a id="non_objectives" name="non_objectives">1.2 Implementation Report non-objectives</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li>The IR does not attempt full conformance testing of implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Although results were generated with a combination of automated and manual tests,
  the automated tests were only meant to provide assistance to implementers in preparing their individual implementation
  test reports.
</p>

<h2 id="h_cr_work"><a id="cr_work" name="cr_work">2. Work during the Candidate Recommendation period</a></h2>
<p>
  During the CR period, the Working Group carried out the following activities:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Clarification and improvement through the exposition of the specification</li>
	<li>Disposing of comments that were communicated to the WG during the CR period.
        These comments and their resolution are detailed in the
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues">GitHub Issue tracker</a>
        with the label <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues?q=label%3A%22CR+period%22">CR&nbsp;period</a>.</li>
	<li>Preparation of this Implementation Report.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="h_participate"><a id="participate" name="participate">3. Participating in the Implementation Report</a></h2>
<p>
  Implementers were invited to contribute to the assessment of the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-thing-description-20190516/">Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description Candidate Recommendation</a>
  by submitting implementer reports describing the
  coverage of their implementations with respect to the test assertions outlined
  in the <a href="#automated_validation_results">table below</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Implementer reports were collected through the W3C WoT Interest Group's
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/07/wot-ig-charter.html#scope">PlugFest</a> activity and collected
  in the GitHub repository
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot/tree/master/testing/tests/2019-05/">https://github.com/w3c/wot</a>
  under <code>testing/tests/2019-05/</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Comments on this document, or requests made for
  further information were posted to the Working Group's public
  mailing list <a href="mailto:public-wot-wg@w3.org">wot-wg@w3.org</a>
  (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wot-wg/">archive</a>)
  and as issues on the GitHub repository

</p>

<h2 id="h_pr_entrance_crit"><a id="pr_entrance_crit" name="pr_entrance_crit">4. Entrance criteria for the Proposed Recommendation phase</a></h2>
<p>
  The Web of Things (WoT) Working Group established the following
  entrance criteria for the Proposed Recommendation phase in the
  Request for CR:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Sufficient reports of implementation experience have been
    gathered to demonstrate that Things can be described by Thing Descriptions
    in sufficient detail to allow interoperabilty.
  </li>
  <li>
    Specific Implementation Report requirements (<a href="#report_reqs">outlined below</a>) have been met.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Working Group has formally addressed and responded to all
    public comments received by the Working Group.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  All three of these criteria have been met.
<!--
  Hard to count since some implementations have multiple components, and some are shared.  Omit.
  A total of N implementations were documented by M different organizations.
-->
  The testimonials below indicate the broad base of support
  for the specification. All of the required features had at least
  two implementations.
  All of the optional features also received at least one implementation.
  However, these optional features do not have
  conformance requirements that have an impact on interoperability.
</p>

<h2 id="h_report_reqs"><a id="report_reqs" name="report_reqs">5. Implementation Report requirements</a></h2>

<h4 id="h_DetailedReqs"><a id="DetailedReqs" name="DetailedReqs">5.1 Detailed requirements</a></h4>
<ol>
	<li>
    Testimonials from implementers are included in the IR when
    provided to document the utility and implementability of the
    specification.
  </li>
	<li>
    IR must cover all specified features in the specification. For
    each feature the IR should indicate:
    <ul>
	     <li>Feature status: required, optional, other.</li>
	     <li>Feature utility/usefulness based on feedback from implementers.</li>
	     <li>Implementability of the feature specification.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Feature status is a factor in test coverage in the report:
    <ul>
		  <li>
        Required specification features must have at least two
        implementations. Implementations that do not implement a required
        specification feature must document the reason for not implementing
        the feature.
      </li>
		  <li>
        Optional specification features must have at least one implementation.
        Implementations that do not implement an optional specification
        feature should document the reason for not implementing the feature.
      </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Feature status is in practice indicated by
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC&nbsp;2119</a> assertions
  associated with the feature.  Features defined using any assertions
  containing the words MUST are considered required.
  Features defined using MAY and SHOULD assertions are considered optional.
</p>

<h4 id="h_NotesOnTesting"><a id="NotesOnTesting" name="NotesOnTesting">5.2 Notes on testing</a></h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    An implementer report must indicate the outcome of evaluating 
    the implementation with respect to each of the assertions defined in the specification.
    Possible outcomes are <code>pass</code>, <code>fail</code>, or <code>not-impl</code> (not implemented).
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="h_out_of_scope"><a id="out_of_scope" name="out_of_scope">5.3 Out of scope</a></h4>
<p>This implementation Report will not cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Conformance testing results</li>
  <li>Interoperability testing results</li>
  <li>All possible combinations of metadata that TDs could describe</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_systems"><a id="test-systems" name="test-systems">6. Systems</a></h2>
<p>
  This section contains descriptions of each of the implementations
  of the WoT Thing Description specification
  from all organizations that submitted implementer reports.
  Each implementation represents a working system
  that either exposes or consumes at least one WoT Thing Description.
  Implementations that expose a network interface
  described by a Thing Description will be referred to as "servers".
  Implementations that consume Thing Descriptions
  will be referred to as "clients".
  Note that these terms will be used with these specific definitions 
  in the following regardless of which device initiates
  network requests.  Normally the client initiates requests and the
  server responds.  However, in some protocols or sub-protocols that
  support push notifications (such as webhooks or MQTT) the usual
  relationship of initiator/responder may be reversed.
  In some cases a given implementation may be used for multiple Things
  and a single Thing may also act as both client and server on
  multiple interfaces.
</p>
<p>
  We only count systems with mostly independent code bases
  as distinct implementations.
  There are however some cases (documented in the following) where
  implementations shared components but were still considered substantially
  independent implementations.  In cases where a substantial component
  was shared across implementations the features supported by that
  component were only counted once.
</p>

  <!-- system implementation descriptions will be inserted here -->

<h2 id="h_security"><a id="security" name="security">7. Security</a></h2>
<p>
  The
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description</a>
  specification includes features to support security.
  Functional aspects of assertions associated with security features are validated
  in the same fashion as other functional features.
  In addition, however, the
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/12/wot-wg-2016.html">Web of Things (WoT) WG Charter</a>
  requires the development of a test plan that includes adversarial testing.
  An appropriate security test plan, including a description
  of how existing web service penetration testing tools can be used,
  in addition to a description of more general security and privacy considerations,
  is included in
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-security">Web of Things (WoT) Security and Privacy Guidelines</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="h_test_results"><a id="test_results" name="test_results">8. Test results</a></h2>
<p>
  The aim of this section is to summarize the assertions from the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description</a>
  specification and summarize the results from the implementation
  reports received in the CR period.
  The tables in each section below lists all assertions derived from the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description</a>
  specification.
  The results are broken into two parts: those for which automated testing has been implemented,
  and those for which it has not and manual testing and reporting was necessary.
</p>
<p>
  The headers for these tables are described as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <b>ID</b> column uniquely identifies the assertion.
    and links to the assertion in the context of the specification.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Category</b> column groups assertions by function.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Req</b> column is a Y/N value indicating
    whether the assertion is for a feature which is required.
    Note however that the feature may only be required if another feature is
    also used or in a particular context, as indicated in
    the <b>Context</b> column.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Context</b> column indicates that the "required" status of this feature depends on the use
    of other features.
    If the context is itself optional,
    then the value of <b>Req</b> actually indicates whether the feature is required
    if the indicated context exists.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Assertion</b> column specifies the constraint which must be met.
    Note that this text may contain errors as it is automatically drawn
    from the specification source before ReSpec processing, so automatic
    content provided by ReSpec such as section headings will be missing.
    If the assertion is actually given in a tabular form in the
    specification, appropriate text is generated but this may not match the
    text in the specification itself.  To fully understand the assertion please
    look at the assertion in context in the specification using the provided
    hyperlink.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Parent</b> column indicates another more general assertion that this one is a specialization of.
    A specialization indicates a more restrictive context or provides additional detail to facilitate testing.
    The more general assertion is only considered to have a "pass" status if all its required
    or implmented specializations in a given implementation have a "pass" status.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Result</b> column is annotated with the number of
    <code>pass</code> (<b>P</b>),
    <code>fail</code> (<b>F</b>), and
    <code>not-impl</code> (<b>N</b>)
    status results in the individual implementer reports.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>T</b> column indicates the total number of implementations (or implementation components in the case
    of shared components) reporting a status (of any kind) on each assertion.
    The totals do not sum to a consistent value since not all implementations have provided information on all
    assertions.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In the case of assertions with multiple mutually exclusive options (for example, enumerated values)
  each of these options may be tested separately and the results combined.
  In this case the 'pass' and 'total' values reported are the minimum value of any of the more detailed tests,
  while the 'fail' and 'not implemented' values report the maximum value of any of these tests.
  Since minimum and maximum value may be drawn from different detailed tests, the
  sum of the 'pass', 'fail', and 'not implemented' cases may not equal the 'total'.
  Instead the total represents the number of implementations for which all options were tested.
  For such cases the "child" assertions have underscores in their names
  prior to each value tested and the table row is also rendered in a 
  different color.
</p>
<!--
<p class="at-risk">
  Assertions which have been indicated as at-risk in the CR publication
  are indicated using yellow highlighting.  
  If these have insufficient implementation
  experience (fewer than two independent implementations for mandatory features
  and one for optional features) they
  may be removed from the final Recommendation.
</p>
