<h4 id="impl-tum-micropythonbare">Bare Micropython Light Sensor: TD Producer</h4>
<p>A light sensor that is attached to an ESP 8266 board that is programmed in Micropython. The board is resource constrained and does not allow installation of HTTP server libraries like Flask. That is why it is called <b>bare</b>.</p>

<h4 id="impl-tum-pythonflask">Python Flask: TD Producer</h4>
<p>Two implementations using the Flask library for creating an HTTP server. One of the implementations is a camera that can take pictures and the other one is an LED Strip that allows for complex data structures.</p>

<h4 id="impl-tum-mqtt">MQTT Publisher: TD Producer</h4>
<p>Example of an MQTT servient that allows for observable properties. There are also examples on how to use oneOf and null vocabulary terms. This is a running instance at the Eclipse Thingweb server that uses the test.mosquitto online broker.</p>

<h4 id="impl-tum-mqtt-retain">MQTT Publisher with Retain: TD Producer</h4>
<p>Example of an MQTT servient that allows for observable and readable properties. It uses the Mosca MQTT broker that is available from Node-Red. The values pushed are temperature values that vary between 10 and 11.</p>

<h4 id="impl-tum-hue">Philips HUE: TD Producer</h4>
<p>TDs for different HUE devices, including the Bridge. These TDs show that we can describe already existing devices with TDs</em></p>
