<h3 id="test_interop_h"><a id="test_interop" name="test_interop">8.2 Interoperability results</a></h3>
<p>This section documents specific pairs of implementations for which
interoperability has been demonstrated. 
Each row represents a producer and each column a consumer.
If a pairing has at least one recorded instance of interoperation,
and no recorded failures, then it is marked as a "Pass".
If a pairing also has at least one recorded instance that uses a 
security configuration identified in
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-security/">WoT Security Best Practices</a> 
then it is marked as "Secure".
However, if such a pairing has <em>any</em> reported failures, no matter how many
other successful pairings it has, including secure pairings,
it is marked as a "Fail".
Note that since implementations refer to code bases that may
be used for many services or devices, 
each successful pairing reported may in practice correspond 
to a number of successful service or device pairings.
