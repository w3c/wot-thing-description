  <section id="abstract">
This document describes a formal model and common representation for a Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description. A Thing Description describes the metadata and interfaces of Things, where a Thing is an abstraction of a physical entity that provides interactions to and participates in the Web of Things. Thing Descriptions provide a narrow-waist set of interactions based on a small vocabulary that makes it possible both to integrate diverse devices and to allow diverse applications to interoperate. Thing Descriptions, by default, are encoded in JSON-LD. JSON-LD provides both a powerful foundation to represent knowledge about Things and simplicity, since it allows processing as a JSON document. In addition to physical entities, Things can also represent virtual entities. A Thing Description instance can be hosted by the Thing itself or hosted externally due to Thing's resource restrictions (e.g. limited memory space) or when a Web of Things-compatible legacy device is retrofitted with a Thing Description.

<!-- for devices.
The TD must be acquired to use and interact with the Thing, since it describes the semantics of a Thing as well as its <a>WoT Interface</a>. Usually, Things directly provide their own TD, but the TD can also be hosted externally if there is not enough space on the device or when a WoT-compatible legacy device is retrofitted with a TD.-->

  <section id="introduction">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
The W3C Thing Description (TD) is a central building block in a Web of Things (WoT) enabled system and can be considered as the entry point of a Thing (aka the <i>index.html</i> of the Thing). The TD consists of semantic metadata for the Thing itself, a narrow-waist interaction model with WoT's Properties, Actions, and Events, a semantic schema to make data models machine-understandable, and features for Web Linking to express relations among Things. 
</p>
<p>
Properties can be used for controlling (or retrieving) parameters, such as a setting an operation state (or getting the current value). Actions model invocation of physical processes, but can also be used to abstract RPC-like calls of existing platforms. Events cover the push model where state change notifications, discrete events, and streams of values are sent asynchronously to the receiver. In general, the TD provides metadata for the different communication bindings (e.g., HTTP, CoAP, MQTT, etc.), mediaTypes (e.g., "application/json", "application/xml", "application/cbor", "application/exi" etc.), and security policies (authentication, authorization, etc.). The default serialisation of the TD is JSON-LD.
</p>

<p>
Example 1 shows a simple TD instance in JSON serializiation that reflects WoT's Property, Action, Event paradigm by describing a lamp Thing with the name <i>MyLampThing</i>.
</p>

<pre class="example" title="Simple Thing Description Sample">
{
    "id": "urn:dev:wot:com:example:servient:lamp",
    "name": "MyLampThing",
    "properties": {
        "status" : {
            "type": "string",
            "form": [{"href": "coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/status"}]
        }
    },
    "actions": {
        "toggle" : {
            "form": [{"href": "coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/toggle"}]
        }
    },
    "events":{
        "overheating":{
            "type": "string",
            "form": [{"href": "coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/oh"}]
        }
    }
}
 </pre>




<p>Based on this content, we know there exists one Property interaction resource with the name <i>status</i>. In addition, information is provided such as that this Property is accessable over the CoAP protocol with a GET method (default assumption as descripted in the W3C WoT protocol template deliverable [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]]) at coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/status (announced within the <code>form</code> structure by the <code>href</code> key), which will return a string status value within a JSON structure (as default assumption).
</p>

<p>In a similar manner an Action is specified to toogle the switch status using the POST method that is applied to the coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/toggle resource (see CoAP protocol binding description in the W3C WoT protocol template deliverable [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]]).</p>

<p>Events which are, e.g., unexpected or irregular can be specified with the WoT's Event model. Here, a subscription of a possible overheating event of the lamp can be applied by using CoAP OBSERVE at coaps://mylamp.example.com:5683/oh. (see CoAP protocol binding description in the W3C WoT protocol template deliverable [[!WOT-PROTOCOL-BINDING]]).
</p>

<p>
The TD in Example 1 reflects some default assumptions that are not explicitly described. E.g., this includes that the media type of the exchange format of the interactions is based on JSON (=<code>mediaType</code>), the property <i>status</i> is not writable and observable. The TD can be also processed as a RD-based model. In that case, the JSON TD can be simple transformed into a JSON-LD style that will implicitly also contain the default assumption vocabularies (<code>writable</code>, <code>observable</code>, <code>mediaType</code>) due to semantic's open-world assumption. Example 2 shows the TD in JSON-LD 1.1 serializiation that contains the same information as in Example 1.

  <section>
    <h1>Namespaces</h1>

<p>
The namespace for TD is http://www.w3.org/ns/td#. TD itself defines a minimal set of classes and properties of its own. 
</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Conformance</h1>

<p>
  As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples,   and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is
  normative.
</p>
<p>
  The key words <em title="MUST" class="rfc2119">MUST</em>, <em title="MUST NOT" class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</em>, <em title="REQUIRED" class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em>, <em title="SHOULD" class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em>, <em title="SHOULD NOT" class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</em>, <em title="RECOMMENDED" class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em>, <em title="MAY" class="rfc2119">MAY</em>,
  and <em title="OPTIONAL" class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em> in this specification are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]].
</p>

 
<p>
A Thing Description instance complies with this specification if it follows the normative statements in Section <a href="#vocabularyDefinitionSection" class="sec-ref"><span class="secno">5.</span> <span class="sec-title">Vocabulary Definition</span></a>.

    <h1 >Thing Description Serializations</h1>

<p>
  Thing Description instances are modeled on the classes defined in <a href="#vocabularyDefinitionSection" class="sec-ref"></a>, and they are serialized in JSON or <a href="https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/">JSON-LD 1.1</a> by default.

</p>

 

<section id="json-serializiation-section">
    <h1>JSON</h1>

<p>This section introduces the JSON serialization of the Thing Description. </p>

<p>Mainly, all defined core vocabulary as defined in <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definitions" class="sec-ref">Vocabulary Definitions</a> will have a JSON key representation.</p>

<p>The defined types of the vocabulary as defined in <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definitions" class="sec-ref">Vocabulary Definitions</a> will be transtormed to JSON-based types. The following rules are used for vocabularies based on simple type definitions:</p>
	      <ul>
<li><p>Vocabularies that are based on simple types string and anyURI MUST be serialized as JSON string.</p></li>

<li><p>Vocabularies that are based on the simple type unsignedInt MUST be serialized as JSON integer.</p></li>

<li><p>Vocabularies that are based on the simple type double MUST be serialized as JSON number.</p></li>
	      </ul>

<p>All vocabularies in <a href="#sec-vocabulary-definitions" class="sec-ref">Vocabulary Definitions</a> Section associated with class-based types are defined separately for structured JSON type transformation in the following subsections.</p>

    <h2>Thing as a whole</h2>
<p>Each mandatory and required vocabulary, as defined in the class <a href="#thing" class="sec-ref">Thing</a>, MUST be serialized as a JSON key at the top level of the JSON TD document.</p>


<p>The type of the fields <code>properties</code>, <code>actions</code>, <code>events</code>, and <code>securityDefinitions</code> MUST be serialized as a JSON object.</p>

<p>The type of the field <code>links</code> MUST be serialized as a JSON array.</p>

<p>Events (and sub-events) offered by a Thing are collected in the <code>events</code> field of (unique) Event names as JSON keys. Each required vocabulary, as defined in the class <a href="#event" class="sec-ref">Event</a>, MUST transformed as a JSON key within a Event field.</p>

<p>The type of the fields <code>properties</code> and <code>items</code> MUST be serialized as a JSON object.</p>

<p>The type of the fields <code>forms</code>, <code>required</code>, and <code>enum</code> MUST be serialized as a JSON array.</p>

    <h1>JSON-LD 1.1</h1>

<p>  JSON-LD 1.1 is a serialization format that adds a semantic layer on top of the JSON specification: the terms that appear in a JSON document
  should be associated with uniquely identified concepts from shared vocabularies. This principle is part of a set of practices to publish data
  on the Web called Linked Data, where concepts are usually identified with URIs and originate from RDF vocabularies.
</p>


  <section id="sec-thing-as-a-whole-json-ld">
    <h2><code>@context</code></h2>

<p>
The  <code>@context</code> key is used to define Thing Description's context. All JSON key terms that are defined in the present document (also see <a href="#vocabularyDefinitionSection">Vocabulary Definition Section</a> ) have been put in an external context document, available at
  <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/td/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld</code>. Each Thing Description instance in JSON-LD MUST have this context information enmbedded within an JSON array structure. Thus, a basic Thing Description would contain the following declaration:
</p>

  <pre class="example">
    {
      "@context": ["https://w3c.github.io/wot/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld"],
      ...
    }
  </pre>

<p>
  In case a single Thing Description instance involves several contexts, additional namespaces with prefixes can be extended to the <code>@context</code> array structure. This option proves relevant if one wants to extend the existing Thing Description context without modifying it. For instance:
</p>
  <pre class="example">
    {
      "@context": ["https://w3c.github.io/wot/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld",
                   {"sensor": "http://iotschema.org/"}],
      ...
    }
  </pre>
<p>

After the <code>@context</code>, each required vocabulary as defined in the class <a href="#thing" class="sec-ref">Thing</a> MUST transformed as a JSON-LD key at the top level. In addition, JSON-LD 1.1 specific keys such as <code>@type</code> to make semantic annotations MAY be applied. An example of a TD snippet based on the defined fields is given below:</p>

  <pre class="example">
        {
          "@context": "https://w3c.github.io/wot/w3c-wot-td-context.jsonld",
          "@type": "Thing",
          "name": "MyThing",
          "id": "urn:dev:wot:com:example:servient:myThing",
          "base": "https://servient.example.com/",
          "description": "Additional (human) readable information of the Thing.",
          "support": "https://servient.example.com/contact",
          "properties": {...},
          "actions": {...},
          "events": {...},
          "securityDefinitions": {...},
          "links": [...]
        }
