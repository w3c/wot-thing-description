# TD.Next Usability and Design Work Items

Changes that improve readability, the usability of the specification OR development, spec generation, bug fixes, and testing of the specification do not need use cases.
These have more priority since they can impact how new features look like in a TD instance.

## Design Document

We should start a TD (re)design document that explains the idea behind the design of different features. See [issue 1889](https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/1889).

## Document reorganization

Changes that should be done while keeping the current content

### Common Definition Section

Usability and readability improvements for not needing to "jump around" while reading

### Grouping of Normative Requirements

Making sure that important normative text is not scattered around too much.

### Assertion id Alignment

Adding `td`, checking naming scheme

### Better Integration of Thing Model

There were questions about how much a TM is related to the TD.
Some discussion might be needed.

## Synchronization with Other Documents

### Discovery Sync

Moving discovery-related text from TD to Discovery

### Architecture Sync

Checking overlaps with architecture.

## Reusable TD Elements

### Reusable Connections

See the [proposal document](../../proposals/initial-connection/README.md) for more information.

### Data Schema Mapping

![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/w3c/wot-thing-description/data%20mapping)

Also known as: Mapping TD elements to messages

- Some protocols have a main channel and auxiliary/ancillary/side channels to exchange information, e.g HTTP has Headers, URI-Variables, Payload/Body.
- Some protocols may have a default/unique `contentType` for at least one of the channels, others are fixed or flexible. e.g. HTTP Headers are key-value strings, Modbus uses only boolean and 16bit quantities.
- Some protocols do not have the concept of `contentType` at all.
- Some `contentType` may be more expressive than our DataSchema, e.g. CBOR [Maps with integer keys](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#map-keys).

#### Open questions

- How can we describe how the logical information (state for property, input/output messages for actions, messages for event) is mapped to each channel?
- Do we need to reconsider how we express `contentType` and `contentCoding` in the case more than a channel allows flexible data formats?
- Do we want to provide a way to express a serialization scheme for protocols that have only inflexible (e.g. binary-only) channels, without going through the route of declaring a `contentType`?
- Do we want to provide a way to express a serialization scheme between our DataSchema and richer contentTypes (e.g XML, CBOR)?

### Security Schemes Refactoring

![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/w3c/wot-thing-description/Security) ![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/w3c/wot-thing-description/Binding)

The need to be refactored and use the same pattern as other reusable elements

Relevant discussions:

- https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/1394

### Inline Security

![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/w3c/wot-thing-description/Security) ![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/w3c/wot-thing-description/reusable%20elements)

Simplifying the way to describe security when there is only one mechanism needed to be described (in contrast to needing two terms at the moment)

Relevant discussions:

- https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/pull/945

### Reusable Element Design

![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/w3c/wot-thing-description/Security)

Scenarios, requirements, and use the same pattern for all reusable elements.
This will influence the items above.

## Affordance Uniformity

![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/w3c/wot-thing-description/affordance%20uniformity)

Uniform pattern/state machines between Actions, Events, and Properties.

- Avoid doing the same thing in a different way, for example how to express observability and cancellation
- Relationships across affordances, for example when an Action changes the state of a Property
- Property vs. Action (also URI Variables redesign question)

## Normative Parsing, Validation, Consumption

![GitHub labels](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/w3c/wot-thing-description/Validation)

Currently, the TD specification defines an abstract information model and a default JSON serialization for TDs.
However, parsing, consuming and validating TDs are not normatively defined.
A validation process is defined but is not normative, which leads to certain ambiguities for a Consumer parsing a TD.
Additionally, no method is proposed for validation of the extensions that are used via the prefixes and the @context.
The WG will specify normative algorithms for parsing, consuming and validating TDs to ensure interoperability of Consumers.

### TD Validation

What is a valid TD, are there any levels of validness?

- A TD validator can do only JSON Schema validation but that is not enough to test everything.
- A TD may be not completely valid but usable by a "degraded consumer" (see below) or a TD can be completely valid according to all the assertions and protocol bindings but not be usable by some consumers.

Additionally, we need better validation of protocols and associated security in the TD.

### Consumption Rules

Do we want to prescribe how TDs are processed and consumed beyond the text level?

### Degraded Consumption

- Rule for uniform degradation across consumers, e.g. TD too big, protocol or protocol options unknown, contentType unknown, etc.
